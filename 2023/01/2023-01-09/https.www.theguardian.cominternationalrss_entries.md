## Nketiah doubles up as Arsenal run away from Oxford in second half

<p>This was not an occasion for the history books but everybody came out with something to grasp. A mid-strength Arsenal were too good for Oxford in the second half, having slogged through a turgid first, and prevailed via Mohamed Elneny and a brace from Eddie Nketiah. Much good may it do them, given a visit to Manchester City is up next, but a banana skin was avoided and their third-tier opponents can claim to have given them a good contest for the majority. Less palatable for Mikel Arteta was the sight of Bukayo Saka hobbling off before the third goal with the north London derby six days away.</p><p>Arteta has formed a habit of going strong in the cups, regardless of opposition, and this occasion was no different. While he shuffled the pack there were still starts for Saka, Nketiah and Gabriel Martinelli, the front three nailed on to face Spurs on Sunday. Among a healthy raft of contingencies on the bench was Emile Smith Rowe, whose return after four months laid low with injury will be a huge boost for the season’s second half if it is sustained.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/09/oxford-united-arsenal-fa-cup-third-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Joy of the playground defined Gareth Bale more than records or trophies

<p>Wales forward retires with a glittering CV but it was his breathtaking style which truly set him apart from the rest</p><p>For Gareth Bale, the pitch and the playground may as well have been the same thing. Watch back some of his greatest goals and you can almost glimpse the school tie flapping behind him as he runs, a battered sponge ball sticking to his feet, the cautious teacher carrying a tray of orange squash across the penalty area. </p><p>Of course Bale always played to win. But in the 30-yard screamers and lightning bursts of speed, you can spot something else there too: a young man playing for the sake of playing, for the thrill of solving a new problem, playing to <em>feel</em>. What was the point in running unless you were going to do it as jaw-droppingly fast as possible? What was the point in taking a free-kick unless you were going to leather it into the top corner? And what was the point of being a footballer at all if you didn’t try these things? </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/09/joy-of-the-playground-defined-gareth-bale-more-than-records-or-trophies">Continue reading...</a>

## Heavenly powers or something rotten? When Richard Burton played Hamlet

<p>It was a box-office hit directed by John Gielgud and created turmoil on stage and off. Now, the 1964 Broadway staging has inspired The Motive and the Cue, a new play by Jack Thorne</p><p>In 1964 Richard Burton played Hamlet on Broadway in a modern-dress production directed by John Gielgud. By commercial standards, it was a roaring success: it ran for <a href="https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/hamlet-3062">17 weeks</a>, breaking a record previously <a href="https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/hamlet-11205">held by Gielgud himself</a>, and was packed out every night. But, for many of those involved, it was not a happy experience. And that is the subject of a new play by Jack Thorne, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/22/mark-gatiss-johnny-flynn-sam-mendes-play-about-hamlet-national-theatre-the-motive-and-the-cue">The Motive and the Cue</a>, which starts previewing at the National Theatre in April, directed by Sam Mendes with Johnny Flynn as Burton, Mark Gatiss as Gielgud and Tuppence Middleton as Elizabeth Taylor, who had married Burton during the production’s Toronto tryout and whose offstage presence was a source of permanent distraction.</p><p>There are endless testimonies as to the tensions caused by the production. Melvyn Bragg in Rich, his Burton biography, reveals how the actor felt so unprepared that before the first performance he summoned his mentor and surrogate father, Philip Burton, to Toronto to privately take him through the text. Gielgud later lamented: “The American cast did not understand very much of what I was trying to do. All they wanted was motivation.” Best of all is Letters from an Actor by William Redfield, the production’s Guildenstern, in which, while sympathetic to Burton and Gielgud, he says: “Between the two men there is an artistic disagreement, an aesthetic split. It is a fundamental difference of both belief and technique.” All of which suggests Thorne has plenty to get his teeth into.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/09/hamlet-richard-burton-john-gielgud-the-motive-and-the-cue-jack-thorne">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was Andorra v Oviedo again, but this time Quique Setién wasn’t watching. He was busy and had better things to do</p><p>Quique Setién started the season at Real Oviedo, where the football ground is overlooked by <a href="https://twitter.com/juanjocastro/status/1612432774488629249?s=20&amp;t=6lzrjZO-8yvOJ68qDBdyOA">a 30-metre Jesus Christ</a>. He hadn’t come to coach and had no intention of going anywhere else to do so either. Everyone knows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/14/quique-setien-barcelona-job-cows-new-manager">there are cows</a> in his tiny hometown of Liencres, human population 3,537; what fewer know is that there is a club there too and as far as the former Barcelona boss was concerned, Marina Sport Under-19s were his team now, the only place he wanted to be. The professional game was best left to other people, one man in particular, so he had come along the north coast to watch one of the few sides that inspired him and support a friend.</p><p>It was August, the opening weekend. Eder Sarabia was making his “professional” debut aged 41 and 18 months into his own career. Until then, the son of Setién’s former teammate Manu Sarabia, 22 years younger than the head coach, had been Setién’s assistant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/31/rolling-stone-quique-setien-shows-theres-glory-in-every-game">at Las Palmas</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/nov/12/real-betiss-barcelona-tribute-act-is-even-better-than-the-real-thing">Betis</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/19/quique-setien-spirit-of-johan-cruyff-barcelona-new-manager">Barcelona</a>. Now, with the senior man stopping, he had set out alone <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/15/from-lisbon-to-andorra-sarabia-and-pique-regroup-in-the-mountains">at Andorra</a>, who he brought up from the theoretically amateur, 40-team third tier for the first time. Almost a father figure, Setién followed his progress proudly. That day, he sat high in the west stand as Andorra began life in <em>segunda</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/edersa10/status/1559295385272721408?s=20&amp;t=Tn6P37PpC3U03-eMMnZNtQ">with a 1-0 win</a>. Some will call it luck, he said later, but he knew better.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/09/villarreal-find-their-level-after-setien-shock-to-see-off-real-madrid-la-liga">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Derby-winning owner is yet to pay up after autumn spending spree at the four major prestigious horse racing auctions</p><p>We are scarcely a week into 2023 but Tattersalls, the venerable Newmarket bloodstock sales company, has already supplied a strong contender for the racing world’s Understatement of the Year, after it emerged over the weekend that 17 yearlings which were knocked down for an average of 650,000gns (£68.3k) at Tatts’ showpiece October sale last year have not – as yet – been paid for, and may need to be resold. “Obviously,” a spokesperson for the firm commented in a brief statement, “this is a regrettable situation”.</p><p>It is, in all, just under £11m-worth of “regrettable” at Tattersalls alone, after an individual who was described at the time as a “mystery buyer” went on a major spending spree at the world’s most prestigious yearling auctions last year. Richard Knight, a Newmarket-based bloodstock agent who was bidding on the mystery buyer’s behalf, also signed for five lots worth a total of €1.98m (£1.74m) at Arqana’s Deauville sale in August; three more that added up to €2.92m (£2.57m) at Goffs’ Orby sale, including the €2.6m (£2.28m) top lot; and six at Keeneland in September, worth $4.875m (£4m).

<p>Wine poured – or sipped – from cans is gaining in popularity, and drastically reducing emissions from the industry</p><p>First came the shame. As fellow customers of my smart local Brooklyn wine shop perused the shelves with studious looks, I slithered over to the register. “I’m embarrassed to ask, but you don’t have any wine in cans, do you?” The clerk gestured to a small fridge right beneath my nose. Yes, they had loads of cans. Yes, they were proving super popular. No, he hadn’t tried the one with the fun vintage circus illustration on the label.</p><p>The art on the 187ml can spoke to me, so I took it home, along with four others. Together, they cost around the same amount as the last bottle I’d bought. They tasted even better.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/09/canned-wine-industry-environment">Continue reading...</a>

It’s easy to project on to the future what we feel now, the memories of the suffering so visceral, the evidence of the reckoning clear enough. People still get sick and die from Covid.

Since the band’s tour began in the US last year, clips of the 33-year-old have gone viral: showing him berating security via Auto-Tune, snogging various fans and complaining about menthol cigarettes being thrown on stage. It’s the sort of memeable behaviour one has come to expect from the always-online Healy who, over the last decade, has become one of music’s most compulsively watchable provocateurs thanks to his inescapable charisma, open-mouthed honesty and his band’s self-aware and sparkling 80s pop-rock.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/09/the-1975-review-matty-healy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wedges of pumpkin smothered in olive oil and salt, roasted and added to a starchy bean broth topped with melted parmesan</p><p>It is impressive, I think, when someone can choose a melon or a pumpkin by a sniff or a shake. This ability usually involves nerve, too: the confidence to pick something up and examine it from all sides, and a skin thick enough not to be concerned by stallholders, supermarket managers or signs saying “Do not touch”. I don’t have any of the above, so I’m often disappointed by melons and pumpkins. I told my friend Alice this recently and she revealed her technique while we were shopping at Monteverde market. She often asks stallholders to cut melons, pumpkins or squashes open, promising that she will buy even if it’s furry or flavourless, but in the knowledge it’s a dud. And, of course, the cutter is then in a corner.</p><p>This, too, requires nerves and skin as thick as the knobbly, grey-green pumpkin I stood holding in a shop the other day. Shaking it didn’t tell me much and I didn’t ask, of course. Fortunately, it wasn’t a dud. Nor was it particularly brilliant; despite being a <em>zucca marina di Chioggia</em>, which are usually reliable things, with dense, orange flesh that is first and foremost savoury, with a sweetness that comes after. If only I’d had more nerve, or gone to another shop. Other pumpkin varieties to look out for are squat, dark-green kabocha, which has dry, starchy flesh with a butter and chestnut flavour and just a touch of sweetness; pale green-blue crown prince, which looks like someone has sat on it, and has dense flesh that reminds one of swede and sweet potato; red, green and white-striped turban squash, which indeed does look like a pumpkin wearing a turban, and has gentle flesh like butternut squash.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/09/pumpkin-beans-greens-and-cheese-stew-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The father-son relationship in Sony’s smash hit shows how important actors have become to video games. Its creators discuss their blockbuster success – and the future of gaming</p><p>In Los Angeles last month, Al Pacino walked on stage at the Microsoft theatre in front of an audience of video game developers and performers to present a trophy at the Game awards. Looking pleased but mildly baffled, and struggling to read his autocue, he announced the winner: Christopher Judge, for his performance as Kratos in the video game <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/03/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-walk-among-gods-in-a-mythological-epic">God of War: Ragnarök</a>. Dressed in a sparkling gold suit, Judge enveloped a surprised-looking Pacino in a giant hug before embarking on a 10-minute acceptance speech. “I was the last actor in California to read for this role,” he says. “Back then, if I’d known it was for a video game, I might not have taken it. Boy, how things have changed.”</p><p>Back in the 00s, Sony’s God of War games were notable for several reasons – their jaw-dropping scale, the bite and immediacy of their combat, the sheer spectacle of their fantasy violence – but they were not exactly famed for their characters. Kratos, the protagonist, was an angry lump of muscle whose narrative arc mostly involved killing bigger and bigger things and getting more and more furious. So when Kratos and God of War returned in 2018 after a long hiatus, it was a surprise to find that not only had he left the realm of Greek mythology for Scandinavia, but he was now a widower, accompanied by a young son with whom he struggled to connect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/09/he-gives-us-every-bit-of-himself-how-god-of-wars-actors-hold-the-whole-game-together">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is that Harry Kane and Stormzy arguing over a broken patio tile? This new, CGI-assisted comedy is astonishing to watch – but is it ethically OK?</p><p>Spencer Jones beckons me into a Soho editing suite. “Do you want to see some of the stuff we’ve done so far?” he asks, readying a clip of his new ITV sketch show. It’s funny enough; a young impressionist does an impersonation of Tom Holland griping about something in his flat.</p><p>But then Jones stands up and walks me through to a different room. He closes the door and opens up a laptop. “Now watch this,” he says, grinning. It’s the same clip: same script, same flat, same line delivery. But there’s one small difference – this time, incredibly, the sketch is being performed by Tom Holland. Except it isn’t. My jaw drops open, and my eyes start flitting around wildly, unable to compute what I’m seeing. In other words, I have just had my first experience of Deep Fake Neighbour Wars.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/09/deep-fake-neighbour-wars-interview-itvx-comedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The contrast to Brighton – the UK’s gay capital – is Rochford, where I grew up and still live. It’s worked for me, but it hasn’t always been easy</p><p>I grew up in the straightest place in England and Wales: Rochford, a small town, in Essex. Last week, in figures revealed by the Office for National Statistics from its 2021 census, just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/07/why-is-rochford-england-straightest-place-and-brighton-its-gay-capital">1.6% of the people living in my town said they were LGB+</a> – it was probably even more straight in the mid-90s, when I was about 15 and realised I was gay. Then, it felt like a complete taboo. My way of dealing with it was to try to put it at the back of my mind. I went through school, college and university doing exactly that.</p><p>When I left university and got involved in politics, I didn’t meet many openly gay people. At the time, there were a few out MPs in the Labour government – people such as <a href="https://members.parliament.uk/member/186/contact">Chris Smith</a>, <a href="https://www.benbradshaw.co.uk/">Ben Bradshaw</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentwigg?lang=en">Stephen Twigg</a> – but none in the Conservatives, the party I joined when I was 18, until <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/alan-duncan">Alan Duncan</a> came out a couple of years later. It still felt like a taboo.

<p>This 1948 feature film by Wanda Jakubowska, a Polish survivor of the death camp, is both forthright and nightmarish, and invented the cinematic language with which to make the Holocaust thinkable</p><p>In 1948, Polish socialist film-maker Wanda Jakubowska released this gripping and pioneering film about the Auschwitz death camp in which she herself had recently been imprisoned, using actors and nonprofessionals and partly shooting in what remained of the camp itself.</p><p>Jakubowska’s film influenced every subsequent director of work on the subject, including Resnais, Pontecorvo and Spielberg, and arguably invented the visual and dramatic language with which cinema attempted to make the Holocaust thinkable: the striped uniforms, the blocks, the bunk-beds, the brutal roll-call musters with emaciated prisoners swaying and passing out, the informants, the complicit kapos, the bizarre prisoners’ orchestra which doggedly played as the everyday brutalities were carried out. There were also the different types of Nazi: the icy functionary, the shrill ideologue, the bleary incompetent and, most sickeningly, the Nazi doctor with a negligent, distrait, quasi-civilian detachment. In this film, one takes a newborn baby boy out of the women’s block and executes him with a poison injection (off camera) because he supposes the child is likely to be a criminal or a mental defective.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/09/the-last-stage-review-wanda-jakubowska-auschwitz">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Newcastle need to invest in squad depth, Bryan Gil is in derby contention and Coventry count cost of ‘embarrassing’ loss</p><p>Half a week is a long time in football. On Thursday, for 45 minutes, Chelsea were good enough to make Manchester City look pedestrian. On Sunday, they were so poor that City located their unstoppable mode, which had gone missing since mid-October. Chelsea are now out of both domestic cups, and in the Premier League, after scraping one win from their past eight games, they are closer to the bottom (13 points ahead of Southampton) than the top (19 behind Arsenal).

## Can you use fake tan to contour your face?

<p>Social media says you can save time by using tanning products instead of bronzer to make your face look better sculpted</p><p><strong>The hack<br /></strong>Using fake tan to contour your face as per the advice of social media – what could go wrong? <strong><br /><br />The test<br /></strong>If contouring – the trend of using darker-toned make-up or bronzer to seriously sculpt the face – is your jam, then this hack might save your precious time each day. But I do have the foreboding feeling this might have disaster written all over it. There are so many ways this could fail, from it being patchy, the wrong colour or sweating off – but maybe I’m catastrophising. Some online tutorials suggest using a small make-up brush to paint on the self-tan, but that feels a little scary in case I’m left with a stripy face. Instead, I find a method that suggests I gently exfoliate my face and apply the fake tan with a beauty sponge. I gently dab it along my hairline, underneath my cheekbones and on my jawline, which roughly creates a “three” shape on either side. After four hours, I washed it off, and could see some more definition than usual, but it also looked a tad patchy, almost like I had melasma.</p><p><strong>The verdict?<br /></strong>If you contour your face every day, this could save time, but this technique definitely works better on lighter skin tones. For darker skins wishing to contour, go for a bronzer with some warmth for a better result.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/09/can-you-use-fake-tan-to-contour-your-face">Continue reading...</a>

## The unfinished business of sporting laws and when rule-makers go too far | Simon Burnton

<p>With some word counts longer than novels, including the silliest laws around, some committees need to up their game</p><p>The latest iteration of the laws of association football is 26,868 words long. Despite having to deal with variations for sevens and 10s, rugby union manages to deal with its laws in 22,480. Including field and equipment specifications, hockey sticks to 11,408 words. The latest playing rules of the Darts Regulation Authority amount to barely a third of that, treble-topping out at 4,275 words. The part of the International Weightlifting Federation’s rules that actually concerns lifting weights weighs in at a mere 1,325 words, clean and with minimal evidence of jerks. And so on, all the way down to the World Rock Paper Scissors Association, which requires only 62 words to explain the finer points of its game, those involved having perhaps learned from bitter experience the potential ramifications of overusing paper.</p><p>Every sport has its nuances, it’s just that some have more than others. Cricket, a sport in which a single game can last five entire days, has a bit extra to cover, and, as updated last September, its regulations finally run out after 34,602 words. Add the preface and indices and the entire document hits 37,827. Used wisely, these are enough words to create an entire world – CS Lewis needed just 594 more for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It is almost exactly half as long as Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (but 52 times the length of the conversation between Potter and Oliver Wood which establishes the rules of quidditch), and represents 42% of The Handmaid’s Tale. Like those novels, it attempts to conjure its own, fully-realised alternate reality. But unlike them, no editor intervened when the authors’ imagination ran a little out of control.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jan/09/the-unfinished-business-of-sporting-laws-and-when-rule-makers-go-too-far">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The British PM may believe that compulsory maths is the key to education – but Asawa showed a different path, armed with little more than flour and water</p><p>‘Art will make people better, more highly skilled in thinking and improving whatever business or occupation one goes into. It makes a person broader.” So proclaimed Ruth Asawa in 1976. Born 50 years earlier, she was a US artist hailed for her cocoon-like sculptures made from interlocking, silvery wires that hang from the ceiling and evoke womb-like forms. When lit, they create shadows, enhancing unexpected shapes from every angle.</p><p>Asawa is also remembered as one of the foremost educators in the San Francisco region, having founded the city’s first public arts high school in 1982 – renamed Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts in 2010. Raised on a farm in California by immigrant Japanese parents, as a teenager, Asawa became one of the 100,000 Japanese Americans placed in internment camps after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. In the camp, one of her tutors included Tom Okamoto, an animator for Walt Disney, who no doubt served as an influence for her later fine line drawings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/09/sculptor-ruth-asawa-anti-rishi-sunak">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Soho theatre, London</strong> <br />The sparkling Aussie brings their award-winning Melbourne comedy festival show to the UK</p><p>When Frankie McNair started taking comedy seriously, they tell us, it got boring – so boring they almost quit. Only when the Canberra native rediscovered silly – specifically, with a Harry Hill-alike bit about a “long fork lady” – did they plug back into their love for the artform, and win the best newcomer gong at the Melbourne comedy festival to boot. That show, Relax Your Knees, now arrives in London, advertising the Aussie as a captivating new talent, albeit one whose material isn’t always as sparkling as their personality.</p><p>There’s a lot of housekeeping before McNair gets down to business, much announcing of how crazy they’re going to be – and sometimes I felt this over-articulating of their zaniness could be dialled down. The moments when they show rather than tell – a dotty sequence involving a banana to the eyes, say – are often the most effective. A recurring swerve into the character of a Liza Minnelli-alike cabaret raconteuse works well partly because McNair makes no attempt to contextualise or justify it whatsoever.</p><p>At <a href="https://sohotheatre.com/shows/frankie-mcnair-relax-your-knees/">Soho theatre, London</a>, until 11 January</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/09/frankie-mcnair-relax-your-knees-review-silly-rediscovered">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Logical adventures with cats and cards</p><p>Lewis Carroll, who died 125 years ago on Saturday, was perhaps the world’s greatest populariser of logical puzzles. His most famous book, Alice in Wonderland, is a masterclass in how to turn arcane mathematical logic into whimsy and humour.

## More than a meme: how evil doll horror M3gan toys with deeper issues

<p>Social media erupted when M3gan danced onto smartphones but the film is far smarter – and scarier – than expected</p><p>When a parent gives their child a new toy, it’s really a gift to both of them, the hours of fun that occupy the youngster also afford their caretaker some free time. If a work-from-home mom or dad needs an afternoon to knock out some spreadsheets, or just some damn peace and quiet during the last legs of a road trip, it’s tempting enough to plonk a kid in front of Bluey and call it a day. At a certain saturation point, however, this becomes an easy way out of parenting that can have ruinous results down the developmental road. The digitization of playtime – with kiddie settings now on tablets, where autoplaying streams draw from infinite on-demand content libraries – has brought a renewed urgency to the question of what deleterious effects next-gen tech may have on the mushy, impressionable brains of our precious angels. At the vanguard of this insidious threat looms M3gan.</p><p>Standing 4ft tall and armed with the most cutting-edge artificial intelligence that modern programming has to offer, the “Model 3 Generative Android” represents the final frontier in killer-dolly narratives. She sings. She dances. She wants to be your bestie and she’ll use the blade of an industrial paper-cutter to massacre anyone standing in her way. In her self-titled, star-making movie vehicle released to US theaters this past weekend and in UK ones this week, M3gan drags an august lineage of homicidal playthings into the future with a perfectly pitched flair for campy fun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/09/m3gan-evil-doll-horror-m3gan-deeper-issues">Continue reading...</a>

## Tough Guy: The Life of Norman Mailer by Richard Bradford review – a literary sucker punch

<p>The Naked and the Dead author was a brash and infuriating personality, but he deserves better than this dismissive biography, published to mark the centenary of his birth</p><p>Norman Mailer – when not boozily brawling, dosing himself with hallucinogenic drugs and serially fornicating – was a man with a sacred mission. He regarded himself as a prophet, bringing bad news to a society that had settled into consumerist complacency during the 1950s. Americans believe that they live in God’s own country; Mailer alerted them to “the possible existence of Satan”, who might be residing next door and quietly assembling a private arsenal for use on Judgment Day. Although Mailer looked up at the sky with “religious awe”, what he saw there was a mushroom-shaped cloud that he called “the last deity”. Humanity, he declared, was reeling towards self-destruction. Now that his centenary has arrived (he was born 31 January 1923), I dare anyone – and that includes Richard Bradford, the author of this sensationalised canter through his life – to say that he was wrong.</p><p>True, Mailer was an obnoxious loudmouth. In episodes that Bradford documents with slavering relish, he conducted literary disputes by butting his colleagues: “Once again words fail you,” drawled the coolly disdainful Gore Vidal after one such attack.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/09/tough-guy-the-life-of-norman-mailer-by-richard-bradford-review-a-literary-sucker-punch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A spectacular drag queen convention saw thousands flock to the ExCeL London this weekend, with events showcasing a world of vibrance, acceptance, love and positive energy</p><p>There are a few theories of the origin of “drag”. One being that it came from theatre, before women were allowed to be on stage. It is reported that DRAG was written as a direction for the male actors, standing for “dress as girl”. Others say that male actors would complain when wearing the women’s frocks, saying that the women’s dresses would “drag” across the floor. Or if you look it up on Wikipedia, another theory is that the word may have been based on the term “grand rag”, which was historically used for a masquerade ball.</p><p>Whatever its origin, drag has certainly come a long way. And there is no better place to see the advancement and growth in popularity than at the world’s biggest drag event: RuPaul’s DragCon UK, presented by World of Wonder.</p><p>Maxi Shield, from Australia; Hugaceo Crujiente, from Spain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/09/lets-celebrate-love-rupauls-dragcon-uk-a-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This enigmatic film by two artists recounts 15 years of migration to Europe – but tells us too little about its human subjects</p><p>This brief experimental documentary about migration to Europe comes from the Italian artists Maria Iorio and Raphaël Cuomo and is a collage of unused footage from video pieces they have made together over the past 15 years. It’s a film with interesting things to say about the fortressing of Europe during that time, but I confess to finding it hard going and slightly frustrating. By the end I wondered if it might not have worked better as a gallery installation alongside the duo’s earlier works.</p><p>It opens in 2006, at night on Lampedusa, the tiny Sicilian island where thousands fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East arrive on dinghies and small boats every year. We’re in a car parked on a busy dock and a man, heard not seen, hums a song, trying to remember words in Arabic. This is Abdelhamid, who is Tunisian and employed as a seasonal worker at a hotel on the island. He’s also an interpreter for the film-makers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/09/chronicles-of-that-time-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve seen what happens in countries when wealthy people go private and the rest suffer. Now, from the NHS to rail services, that’s life here</p><p>It’s official. A two-tier health system, that long feared prospect that rings the death knell of the NHS, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/07/revealed-nhs-trusts-tell-patients-they-can-go-private-and-jump-hospital-queues">has arrived</a>. Trusts with long waiting lists are offering and promoting “quick and easy” private services in their hospitals. It’s not a choice anyone would relish, but increasingly those who can are giving up and paying up. If you’re after a hip replacement, £1,200 can make the difference between a two-year and a two-week wait. You can get an MRI for £379 in 48 hours, and with it a diagnosis that could save a limb or a life.</p><p>The story is the same across England’s public infrastructure. Those who can, after standing on a packed train platform, the clock ticking down to an important appointment, will decamp above ground and take a taxi. Those who can will work several jobs to pay exorbitant and rising rent because they have no access to social housing. Those who can will take the hit, and those who can’t will be stranded, on the streets and in the wards.</p><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/09/state-services-pay-rishi-sunak-britain-private">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Body Heat made her a star in the 80s. Then, after a string of hit movies, illness forced her to take a step back. The actor talks about her fights with directors, her rage at white male privilege and her return to the screen as a foul-mouthed political lobbyist</p><p>Kathleen Turner is pondering her acting career, a smile playing on her lips. “I’m becoming legendary, which I think only means that I have been around that long,” she purrs regally. It is, after all, more than 40 years since Lawrence Kasdan’s erotic thriller Body Heat turned her into one of Hollywood’s most in-demand stars.</p><p>Now, at 68, she’s coming to TV screens with White House Plumbers, playing Dita Beard, a foul-mouthed lobbyist involved in the Watergate scandal that ruined president Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. HBO’s new political drama revolves around E Howard Hunt (Woody Harrelson) and G Gordon Liddy (Justin Theroux), two members of a covert White House special investigations unit. They were supposed to protect the presidency, but they ended up bringing it down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/09/ill-never-drink-like-that-again-kathleen-turner-on-booze-health-and-falling-in-love-with-michael-douglas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>His work is freaky and frightening, yet today the Twin Peaks director cuts an almost cosy figure. As he turns 77 – a number of significance – we explore how real life caught up with his dark visions</p><p>Beyond his holiness Saint Keanu, if there is another universally beloved figure online it is David Lynch. He is the internet’s eccentric grandpa: unfailingly ringing in the day with his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DAVIDLYNCHTHEATER">daily weather reports</a>, banging the gong for transcendental meditation and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKwvU_vYdXE">crafting miniature farmyard barns</a> for his youngest daughter, Lula.</p><p>His other line, perhaps the most overtly Lynchian, is his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DAVIDLYNCHTHEATER">daily lottery</a> in which – for seemingly no other reason than gratuitous delight and enigma – he draws a random numbered ball. A confirmed numerologist, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M6mRIpEJSU&amp;list=WL&amp;t=3214s">his preferred integer is seven</a>.

So was the Philadelphia office of Gordon Cole, the FBI chief played by the director in Twin Peaks. On 20 January, David Lynch will be 77. So there is no better time to ask: how did this once-cult artist – whose work is filled with seething psychopaths and funky dwarves and who for the past 20 years has reverted solely to his most experimental and challenging work – become such a cosy cultural presence?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/09/david-lynch-twin-peaks-director-predicted-our-times">Continue reading...</a>
