<p>Were you irked that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-tests-new-home-screen-designs-172508288.html">Instagram's shopping obsession</a> relegated the "new post" button to a corner? You're not alone. Instagram has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDY2NjUxZS02NThlLTRiYWEtYmM0ZS1kZWQwYzEyNmU4MDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL2hlbHAvaW5zdGFncmFtLzU0MTk4MjA3MTE4ODIyMyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWYxOWViYTctNGIzZC00OTY3LWFiZjUtMDNlODY3M2UwNzRhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWbvtGRdw-W6Jhai8KXG1_OjMM8Na2hmwVnMCAtFgWfG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Finstagram%2F541982071188223">revealed</a> a home screen refresh, due in February, that axes the Shop tab and moves the Create button back to the center of the bottom navigation bar. That, in turn, shunts the Reels tab to the side.</p><p>The social network's Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CnNCWSwPgDb/?hl=en">added</a> in a video that shopping will still exist in your feed, Reels, Stories and ads. There just won't be a dedicated tab for it.

In a video <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CnNCWSwPgDb/?hl=en">announcing</a> the rollout, Mosseri characterized the refresh as a bid to "simplify" the service and focus on connecting people to the "things they love." Insta is remembering that it's a social network, to put it bluntly.</p><p>However, the change may also be part of a larger strategy shakeup. As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/9/23546755/instagram-removes-shopping-tab-home-feed-main-navigation-reels">notes</a>, <em>The Information</em><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaW5zdGFncmFtLXNjYWxpbmctYmFjay1zaG9wcGluZy1mZWF0dXJlcy1hbWlkLWNvbW1lcmNlLXJldHJlYXQ_cmM9d2hmMGZkIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxZjE5ZWJhNy00YjNkLTQ5NjctYWJmNS0wM2U4NjczZTA3NGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAViyx1XpYhrbRp96AcfkJ0p0MUfdqpXnV1XrF1O-XzA8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Finstagram-scaling-back-shopping-features-amid-commerce-retreat%3Frc%3Dwhf0fd">claimed</a> to have seen an internal memo in September indicating that Instagram would cut many of its shopping features. Instead, the site would concentrate on commerce efforts that are "more directly tied" to ad revenue. Simply put, the shopping push doesn't appear to have helped — this would boost Meta's bottom line as it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-q3-2022-earnings-211903277.html">pivots to the metaverse</a>.</p><p>There's also the matter of competition. TikTok, the inspiration for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-tiktok-rival-164624402.html">numerous Instagram features</a>, still features a prominent "new post" button. That placement isn't a guarantee of success, of course, but that platform has continued to thrive in spite of Instagram. It had about 1.64 billion monthly active users as of October, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdGlrdG9rLXB1c2hlcy1zb2NpYWwtZmVhdHVyZXMtYXMtZ3Jvd3RoLWNvb2xzP3JjPXdoZjBmZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWYxOWViYTctNGIzZC00OTY3LWFiZjUtMDNlODY3M2UwNzRhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZ8cSFnR2ss_rRETgbOW33hOSulRnpBuBQPMzhL5pc77&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Ftiktok-pushes-social-features-as-growth-cools%3Frc%3Dwhf0fd">according</a> to Data.ai figures.

## Meta rolls out AI ad-targeting tech in an effort to reduce discrimination
 - [https://www.engadget.com/meta-anti-discrimination-ad-technology-200037894.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/meta-anti-discrimination-ad-technology-200037894.html?src=rss)

<p>Meta is acting on its vow to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-housing-discrimination-settlement-191710885.html">reduce ad discrimination</a> through technology. The company is rolling out a Variance Reduction System (VRS) in the US that ensures the real audience for an ad more closely matches the eligible target audience — that is, it shouldn't skew unfairly toward certain cultural groups. Once enough people have seen an ad, a machine learning system compares the aggregate demographics of viewers with those the marketers intended to reach. It then tweaks the ad's auction value (that is, the likelihood you'll see the ad) to display it more or less often to certain groups.</p><p>VRS keeps working throughout an ad run. And yes, Meta is aware of the potential privacy issues. It stresses that the system can't see an individual's age, gender or estimated ethnicity. Differential privacy tech also introduces &quot;noise&quot; that prevents the AI from learning individual demographic info over time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The anti-discrimination method will initially apply to the housing ads that prompted the settlement. VRS will reach credit and employment ads in the country over the following year, Meta says.</p><p>The feature comes after more than a year of work alongside both the Justice Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Meta (then Facebook) was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-28-facebook-housing-discrimination-charges.html">charged in 2019</a> with enabling discrimination in housing ads by letting advertisers exclude certain demographics, including those protected by the Fair Housing Act. In a June 2022 settlement, the social media giant said it would both deploy VRS and scrap the &quot;Special Ad Audience&quot; tool whose algorithm allegedly led to discrimination. Meta had already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-19-facebook-limits-ad-targeting-to-reduce-discrimination.html">limited ad targeting</a> in 2019 in response to another lawsuit.</p><p>Meta isn't alone in trying to limit discriminatory ads. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-discriminatory-ad-targeting-jobs-housing-credit-105655084.html">Google barred advertisers</a> from targeting credit, housing and job ads starting in 2020. However, the tech used to fight that discrimination is relatively novel. It won't be surprising if other internet services implement VRS-like systems of their own so long as Meta's AI proves effective.</p>

## YouTube will begin sharing ad revenue with Shorts creators on February 1st

<p>YouTube's long-awaited revenue-sharing program for Shorts creators is nearly ready.  Starting today, the company is rolling out a new Partner Program agreement ahead of February 1st, when creators can begin earning ad share revenue on their Shorts views. Creators have until July 10th to accept YouTube's new <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12843009">Partner Program terms</a>. As part of the change, the company is introducing new &quot;Monetization Modules&quot; to give creators more flexibility over how they earn money on YouTube — though the company recommends accepting all of them to unlock your full earning potential on the platform. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-revenue-sharing-shorts-creators-170137275.html">As previously announced</a>, creators with at least 1,000 subscribers and more than 10 million views on Shorts over a 90-day period can apply for the Partner Program. They then need to accept the new &quot;Shorts Monetization Module.&quot;</p><div id="513a7b0f5514438ca5a29f09da370539"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>With Shorts revenue sharing rolling out, YouTube notes its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-100-million-dollar-creator-fund-launch-160058966.html">$100 million creator fund</a> is going away. However, the company expects most fund recipients to earn more through revenue sharing than they did through the fund. The formula YouTube has devised for determining how much each creator will make for their Shorts is complicated due to the involvement of music licensing. As YouTube users watch Shorts, the company will display ads between clips in the Shorts Feed. YouTube says the money generated by those ads will go towards paying music licensing companies and creators through a shared pool the company will divvy out at the end of each month. How much money ends up going to the creator pool will depend on the number of musical tracks creators feature in their Shorts. If you upload a clip with no music, then all the revenue associated with that video will go toward the creator pool. Conversely, when it comes to a Short with a single song, one-third of the related revenue will go toward paying for licensing. In a Short with two songs, two-thirds will go toward licensing.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once that's all sorted out, YouTube will determine how to distribute the creator fund. The company will dole out the fund based on a creator's share of total Shorts views. So say your videos accounted for 5 percent of all eligible Shorts views in your country for the month of February, you would then get 5 percent of the money in the fund, whether you used licensed music in your Shorts or not. YouTube then takes its 55 percent revenue cut, leaving you with 45 percent of what's left. If your contribution to the Creator Pool was $1,000 one month, you would get $450 once everything is said and done.</p>

## NASA's 38-year-old science satellite falls safely to Earth

<p>NASA's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-nasa-ocean-monitoring-swot-satellite-launch-here-090048273.html">38-year-old dead satellite</a> has returned to Earth without incident. The Defense Department has <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAEarth/status/1612473062951161856">confirmed</a> that the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) reentered the atmosphere off the Alaskan coast at 11:04PM Eastern on January 8th. There are no reports of damage or injuries, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/old-nasa-satellite-falls-harmlessly-152357110.html?guccounter=1">according to</a> the <em>Associated Press</em>. That isn't surprising when NASA said there was a 1-in-9,400 chance of someone getting hurt, but it's notable when officials said there was a possibility of some parts surviving the plunge.</p><p>ERBS had a storied life. It travelled to aboard Space Shuttle Challenger in 1984, and pioneering woman astronaut <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/1760/sally-ride-1951-2012/#:~:text=Sally%20Ride%20(1951%2D2012),Space%20%E2%80%93%20NASA%20Solar%20System%20Exploration">Sally Ride</a> placed it in orbit using the robotic Canadarm. Crewmate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_D._Sullivan">Kathryn Sullivan</a> performed the first spacewalk by an American woman during that mission. The satellite was only expected to collect ozone data for two years, but was only retired in 2005 — over two decades later. The vehicle helped scientists understand how Earth absorbs and radiates solar energy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="67ed6ea9f08f466fa1f57e42a80ac422"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Update: <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASA</a>’s retired Earth Radiation Budget Satellite reentered Earth’s atmosphere over the Bering Sea at 11:04 p.m. EST on Sunday, Jan. 8, the <a href="https://twitter.com/DeptofDefense?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DeptofDefense</a> confirmed. <a href="https://t.co/j4MYQYwT7Z">https://t.co/j4MYQYwT7Z</a></p>— NASA Earth (@NASAEarth) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAEarth/status/1612473062951161856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>You might not see much ancient equipment fall to Earth in coming decades. The FCC recently proposed a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-five-year-rule-space-junk-181745779.html">five-year cap</a> on the operation of domestically owned satellites that aren't in geostationary orbits. The current guidelines suggest deorbiting within 25 years.  While there could be waivers for exceptional cases, future satellites like ERBS (which was in a non-Sun synchronous orbit) might bow out long before they're reduced to space junk.</p>

It's still the only truly compact iPad Apple sells, and for those who have smaller hands or just want a slate they can comfortably use with one hand, it's arguably the best tablet in its size range, period. It follows the same design language as most other iPads, with squared edges, a USB-C port, no Home button, a Touch ID sensor and a bright display. (Plus, no headphone jack, sadly.)

## John Deere will let US farmers repair their own equipment

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/john-deere-autonomous-tractor-203054726.html">John Deere</a> has been one of the stauncher opponents of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-right-to-repair-executive-order-211328084.html">right to repair regulation</a>, but it's now willing to make some concessions. Deere &amp; Company has <a href="https://www.fb.org/files/AFBF_John_Deere_MOU.pdf">signed</a> a memorandum of understanding with the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) that lets US farmers and independent repair shops fix equipment, rather than requiring the use of authorized parts and service centers. Users will have access to official diagnostics, manuals, tools and training. Deere will let owners disable electronic locks, and won't bar people from legally obtaining repair resources even if the company no longer offers them.</p><p>The agreement includes some protections for the equipment maker. John Deere won't be required to "divulge trade secrets," or to allow repairs that might disable emissions controls, remove safety features or modify power levels. Unsurprisingly, fixes also can't violate the law.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The memorandum is effective as of January 8th, although John Deere didn't detail exactly how or when it would alter its practices. We've asked the company for comment. In a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtNjQyMDY5MTMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImNmOTg3YzRmLTAyZTUtNDZjMi04YTFkLTM1MjY5MjhkNzNkOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcPfwHtCHmUC5sw2vHIRRK7FiK2dOGqBuWZ_sP-pkdHd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness-64206913">statement</a>, senior VP Dave Gilmore said the company was looking forward to working with customers and the ABFB in the "months and years ahead" to provide repair facilities.</p><p>The pact is characterized as a "voluntary" private arrangement. However, it comes alongside mounting political pressure that effectively gave John Deere little choice but to improve repairability. President Biden ordered the Federal Trade Commission to draft right to repair regulation in 2021, while states like New York have passed their own (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-right-to-repair-law-kathy-hochul-184654713.html">sometimes weakened</a>) legislation. If Deere doesn't act, it risks legal battles that could limit where and how it does business in the country.</p><p>As it stands, the farm equipment maker isn't alone in responding to government action. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-release-date-122332505.html">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-repair-diy-parts-ifixit-182931322.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-ifixit-self-repair-program-available-launch-date-134634384.html">Samsung</a> and other tech brands now have do-it-yourself repair programs in place. Microsoft will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-9-right-to-repair-parts-154305239.html">offer Surface parts</a> to users later this year.</p>

<p>After canceling our CES plans in 2022 (and there wasn’t even a show in 2021), the Engadget team sent a dozen staffers to this year’s CES. The show wasn't as busy as in pre-pandemic years, but many events were packed, and companies had plenty of announcements to dig into. So, what was the best of CES? You can check out all the award winners<a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-of-ces-2023-winners-220009997.html"> right here</a>.</p><p>Our Best of the Best winner wasn’t a car or a TV that sticks to the wall. No, it’s Project Leonardo. This is Sony’s first piece of gaming hardware designed specifically for people with limited motor control – and it’s rather eye-catching.</p><p></p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-accessibility-controller-project-leonardo-021032382.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/036623f0-9012-11ed-bf96-6e55be804172" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure></a><p>This controller kit works out of the box with the PlayStation 5, offering two circular gamepads lined with swappable buttons, third-party accessory ports and other customizable inputs. The controllers sit flat on a table or mounted on a standard tripod. They can also pair with a DualSense to turn all three devices into a single gamepad, offering plenty of flexibility.</p><p>To make sure it delivered on its accessibility promises, Sony partnered with advocacy organizations including AbleGamers, SpecialEffect and Stack Up, much like Microsoft did with the revolutionary Xbox Adaptive Controller. Though there's no release date or price for Project Leonardo yet, Sony is finally seizing an opportunity to expand the PS5 player base.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Raspberry Pi's new 12-megapixel camera modules provide powered autofocus

<p>Raspberry Pi has launched the Camera Module 3 with big improvements, including higher resolution, infrared, HDR, autofocus, a wide angle FOV and more, the company <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-autofocus-camera-modules/">announced</a>. Not counting the interchangeable lens model <a href="https://www.engadget.com/raspberry-pi-12-megapixel-c-mount-camera-084145607.html">introduced in 2020</a>, it's the company's first new camera module in six years.</p><p>The previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-25-raspberry-pi-sony-camera-sensor.html">Module 2 cameras</a> used a Sony IMX219 8-megpixel sensor. However, the new models carry Sony's new 12-megapixel IMX708 chip, which is not only larger but has more resolution. That translates to sharper images and also better low-light sensitivity. It also has a 16:9 aspect ratio, so HD video up to 1080p50 can be captured using the entire sensor area.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Better still, where the previous module had fixed autofocus, Module 3 has built-in powered autofocus capability. That makes them a bit thicker (up to 12.4mm compared to 9mm) but more versatile, letting you focus on objects ranging in distance from 5cm (2 inches) to infinity.&nbsp;</p><div id="82f5cace11444a09bb696f3cb66770fe"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The standard field-of-view (FoV) variants provide a 66 degree horizontal field of view, roughly equivalent to a 28mm full-frame lens. The wide angle version, however, bumps that to 102 degrees horizontal (a 14mm full-frame lens). With a &quot;more expensive and complex optical stack,&quot; the wide-angle version is a bit thicker, 12.4 compared to 11.5mm, according to Raspberry Pi.&nbsp;</p><p>It also offers HDR capability, taking multiple simultaneous exposures with different exposure times. That lets you capture interior shots, for instance, with the correct exposure on both interior and exterior details. And finally, the NoIR (no infrared filter) sensors, first introduced with the Module 2, can effectively convert your Raspberry Pi into a night-vision camera.&nbsp;</p><p>The launch includes no less than four modules, including standard and wide angle models, both in visible light and NoIR infrared versions. Both the normal models start at $25, while the wide angle versions cost $35. They're now available at <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-3/">Raspberry Pi's store</a> .&nbsp;</p>

## Seattle schools sue TikTok, Meta and other platforms over youth 'mental health crisis'

<p>Seattle public schools have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/08/seattle-public-schools-sue-social-media-platforms-youth-mental-health-crisis">sued</a> the tech giants behind TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat, accusing them of creating a &quot;mental health crisis among America's Youth.&quot; The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.317950/gov.uscourts.wawd.317950.1.0.pdf">91-page lawsuit</a> filed in a US district court states that tech giants exploit the addictive nature of social media, leading to rising anxiety, depression and thoughts of self-harm.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Defendants’ growth is a product of choices they made to design and operate their platforms in ways that exploit the psychology and neurophysiology of their users into spending more and more time on their platforms,&quot; the complaint states. &quot;[They] have successfully exploited the vulnerable brains of youth, hooking tens of millions of students across the country into positive feedback loops of excessive use and abuse of Defendants’ social media platforms.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Harmful content pushed to users includes extreme diet plants, encouragement of self-harm and more, according to the complaint. That has led to a 30 percent increase between 2009 and 2019 of students who report feeling &quot;so sad or hopeless... for two weeks or more in a row that [they] stopped doing some usual activities.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Defendants’ misconduct has been a substantial factor in causing a youth mental health crisis, which has been marked by higher and higher proportions of youth struggling with anxiety, depression, thoughts of self-harm, and suicidal ideation. The rates at which children have struggled with mental health issues have climbed steadily since 2010 and by 2018 made suicide the second leading cause of death for youths.</p></blockquote><p>That in turn leads to a drop in performance in their studies, making them &quot;less likely to attend school, more likely to engage in substance use, and to act out, all of which directly affects Seattle Public Schools’ ability to fulfill its educational mission.&quot;</p><p>Section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act means that online platforms aren't responsible for content posted by third parties. However, the lawsuit claims that the provision doesn't protect social media companies for recommending, distributing and promoting content &quot;in a way that causes harm.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We have invested heavily in creating safe experiences for children across our platforms and have introduced strong protections and dedicated features to prioritize their wellbeing,&quot; a Google spokesperson told <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/08/seattle-public-schools-sue-tech-mental-health"><em>Axios</em></a>. &quot;For example, through Family Link, we provide parents with the ability to set reminders, limit screen time and block specific types of content on supervised devices.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We've developed more than 30 tools to support teens and families, including supervision tools that let parents limit the amount of time their teens spend on Instagram, and age verification technology that helps teens have age-appropriate experiences,&quot; Meta's global head of safety Antigone Davis said in a statement. &quot;We'll continue to work closely with experts, policymakers and parents on these important issues.&quot; TikTok has yet to react, but Engadget has reached out to the company.</p><p>Critics and experts have recently accused social media companies of exploiting teens and children. Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen, for one, testified to Congress that &quot;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/technology/haugen-facebook.html">Facebook's products harm children</a>.&quot; Eating disorders expert Bryn Austin wrote in a <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/how-social-medias-toxic-content-sends-teens-into-a-dangerous-spiral/">2021 Harvard article</a> that social media content can send teens into &quot;a dangerous spiral.&quot; And the issue has caught the attention of legislators, who proposed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-kids-online-safety-act-bill-141708555.html">Kids Online Safety Act</a> (KOSA) last year.&nbsp;</p>
