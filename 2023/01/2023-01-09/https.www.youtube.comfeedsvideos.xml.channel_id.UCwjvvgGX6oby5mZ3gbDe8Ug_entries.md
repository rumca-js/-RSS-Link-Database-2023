Comments under the footage are rather interesting. One Chinese wrote: "Xuchang fired the first shot against the ban on fireworks", another wrote: "The experts were disappointed to see it! Some wrote: "Experts are disappointed to see this! Will they secretly call the police?" Others wrote: "Fireworks drive away all evil! Others jokingly wrote, "Those behind the organization and incitement will eventually be brought to justice."
The "White Paper Revolution" has planted the seeds of non-violence and non-cooperation. Civil disobedience will become more decentralized, diverse in its demands, and more persistent. Therefore, even if the Chinese people don't yell out slogans like 'End the CCP,' the CCP is still very scared because what this red party fears most is the people no longer fear.
