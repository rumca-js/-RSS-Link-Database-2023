<p>Apple has reportedly canceled the development of a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-se-3-2022-review-battery-life-camera-sample-touch-id-home-button-130047678.html"><ins>iPhone SE</ins></a>. According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the company recently told suppliers it would not release a fourth-generation SE model sometime in 2024. In a <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/qualcomm-is-the-biggest-winner-of-apples-cancelation-of-2024-iphone-se-4-qualcomm%E7%82%BAapple%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%882024-be804b3462e9"><ins>Medium post</ins></a> spotted by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/06/iphone-se-4-canceled-kuo/"><em><ins>MacRumors</ins></em></a>, Kuo said the device would have been the debut of Apple’s first in-house 5G modem, adding that the company had planned to test and fine-tune the chip on the SE before rolling it out more broadly to the iPhone 16 and beyond. Instead, Kuo suggests Apple is now more likely to continue using Qualcomm modems through 2024.</p><p>Kuo doesn’t say why Apple shelved the fourth-generation iPhone SE or if the performance of its own 5G chip had anything to do with the decision. For the better part of a decade, Apple has tried to reduce its dependence on Qualcomm. In 2019, the two ended their bitter patent feud and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-16-apple-and-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute.html"><ins>signed a “multiyear” wireless chip supply deal</ins></a>. Months later, however, Apple bought the majority of Intel’s mobile modem business. Then, at the end of 2020, the company disclosed it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-in-house-cellular-modem-045611093.html"><ins>working on its own cellular chipset</ins></a>. There’s been little news about the project since.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

## Google asks India’s Supreme Court to block $161.9 million Android antitrust ruling

<p>Google has turned to India’s Supreme Court as a “last hope” to block an order that has the potential to reshape the Android ecosystem. Last October, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-antitrust-fine-india-203910551.html"><ins>fined Google $161.9 million</ins></a> and barred the search giant from requiring OEMs to preinstall Google apps and services on their phones. On Wednesday, an appeals tribunal <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-challenges-android-antitrust-ruling-indias-supreme-court-2023-01-07/?taid=63b9a771c104900001004bc6&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter"><ins>rejected the company’s</ins></a> request to block the ruling, which is scheduled to go into effect on January 19th. According to court documents <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-challenges-android-antitrust-ruling-indias-supreme-court-2023-01-07/?taid=63b9a771c104900001004bc6&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter"><ins>seen by </ins><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, Google filed a challenge against the tribunal’s decision with the country’s top court on Saturday. The company reportedly sees the effort as its last and best hope at preventing the CCI’s order from impacting its business. Google did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request.</p><p>While the $161.9 million fine is tiny for Google, the order is likely to force the company to change its deals with Android manufacturers dramatically. The CCI seeks to prevent Google from including “anti-fragmentation” clauses that bar Android forks. The order would also force the company to allow third-party app stores on Google Play, and allow users to uninstall first-party apps they don’t want on their phones. India is a critical market for Google. The country is home to about 606.6 million smartphone users, and about 97 percent of the phones in India run Android. In other words, the company can’t afford to exit the market.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

But, even though we've switched over to our 2023 calendars, the company took the opportunity at CES to take one more victory lap by showing off its <a href="https://articles.roland.com/soaring-sound-meet-the-piano-of-the-future/">50th Anniversary Concept Piano</a>. It's an audacious electronic piano built in collaboration with Japanese furniture maker Karimoku.

Unfortunately, those couldn't be flown on the show floor at CES, so Roland dangled a pair of them from wires. Those are combined with a proprietary low-latency audio connection and the company's PureAcoustic Ambience tech to create flexible natural sounding reverb that more accurately mimics what you'd hear in, say, a concert hall. And I can confirm that even in the cavernous Las Vegas Convention Center, fighting against the constant din of people and other exhibitors, the concept piano sounded amazing.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Roland 50th Anniversary Concept Piano" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/c524b340-8e09-11ed-b7eb-bd78a52074b7" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Above the keyboard itself there's a large touchscreen that can be used to stream tutorials, video conference with a piano teacher, or even run Zenbeats from Roland Cloud, turning the instrument into a studio hub.

## A dead NASA satellite is returning to Earth after 38 years in space

<p>After nearly four decades in space, NASA’s retried Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) is about to fall from the sky. On Friday, the agency <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/langley/retired-nasa-earth-radiation-budget-satellite-to-reenter-atmosphere">said</a> the likelihood of wreckage from ERBS harming anyone on Earth is “very low.” NASA expects most of the 5,400-pound satellite will burn up upon re-entry. Earlier this week, the Defense Department predicted ERBS would re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere on Sunday at approximately 6:40PM ET, give or take 17 hours.</p><p>While it may be a household name, the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite had anything but a dull history. Per <a href="https://phys.org/news/2023-01-nasa-satellite-falling-sky-weekend.html"><em>Phys.org</em></a>, the Space Shuttle Challenger carried the satellite to space in 1984, a little more than a year before Challenger's heartbreaking demise in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster">early 1986</a>. <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/1760/sally-ride-1951-2012/#:~:text=Sally%20Ride%20(1951%2D2012),Space%20%E2%80%93%20NASA%20Solar%20System%20Exploration">Astronaut Sally Ride</a>, the first American woman to fly to space, released ERBS from Challenger’s cargo hold using the spacecraft’s robotic arm. During that same mission, Ride’s crewmate, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_D._Sullivan">Kathryn Sullivan</a>, became the first American woman to perform a space walk. It was also the first mission to see two female astronauts fly to space together. As for ERBS, it went on to collect ozone and atmospheric measurements until 2005. Scientists used that data to study how Earth absorbs and radiates solar energy. ERBS's contribution to science is even more impressive when you consider NASA initially expected it would only stay functional for two years.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

## The tech pioneer behind Sound Blaster has passed away

<p>Singaporean inventor and tech pioneer Sim Wong Hoo passed away on January 4th at the age of 67. Sim may not be a household name these days, but he founded Creative Technology (or Creative Labs in the US), the company behind the Sound Blaster brand of sound cards, back in 1981. Sound Blasters were some of the first sound cards available to consumers, and there was a time when you had to make sure your system worked with them if you wanted to listen to music and play games.</p><p>Sim established his business in the US and started selling Sound Blasters a few years later, after which Creative became the first Singaporean company to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The integration of sound boards into the motherboard ended Sound Blaster's popularity, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-05/ceo-of-singapore-s-creative-sim-wong-hoo-who-took-on-apple-aapl-dies-at-67?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> says the cards provided audio for more than 400 million PCs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under his leadership, Creative also launched a range of MP3 players, and Sim once <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2004-11-17-creative-declares-war-on-apple.html">tried to take on Apple</a> by spending $100 million on advertising and marketing in its bid to dethrone the iPod. In 2006, Creative sued Apple for violating its patent for portable media system menus. The companies filed more lawsuits against each other after that before Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-08-23-apple-and-creative-settle-apple-forks-out-100m.html">settled with Creative</a> and paid the company $100 million for the technology outlined in its patent.&nbsp;</p><p>Creative <a href="https://us.creative.com/rememberingsim/">confirmed</a> Sim's passing on its website, calling him &quot;a visionary, inventor, and entrepreneur who gave the PC a voice.&quot; In a press release published by the company, interim CEO Song Siow Hui said in a statement:</p><p>&quot;I have known and worked with Mr. Sim for over 30 years. This is a sad and sudden development and we feel a great loss especially since Mr. Sim and I recently had extensive discussions on the future direction of the Company. During those discussions, Mr. Sim was full of fresh vision. Even on the night before, he had a long discussion with the Engineering team and was scheduled to meet with the Online Sales team the next day. The best thing to do now is to ensure the continued smooth running of the Company, and also to execute and realise the vision and strategy that Mr. Sim had for the Company.&quot;</p>

## There was a lot of pee on the CES 2023 show floor

<p>One swallow doesn’t make a summer, and I’m not sure if you can count <em>four</em> instances of a product as a trend, but it’s certainly an interesting thread at this year’s CES. At this year’s show, a quartet of companies are showing off urine analysis tools designed to be used at home by the general public. These are positioned as a natural evolution of the fitness tracker, a device you can use to keep an even closer eye on your health and fitness. Most of them are built for your toilet, testing your pee for any number of easy-to-identify maladies. But is this the next great frontier of consumer health tracking? That rather depends on the public’s desire to delve deep into their own bladders.</p><p>My cynical take: I suspect the reason we’re seeing these pop up is because the wearables world is now played out. Back in 2019, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-future-of-fitness-wearables-ifa-2019.html">I wrote</a> that we’d reached the point where there were no new features that could be fitted to a smartwatch, fitness tracker or ring. Or, at least, none that were as valid, effective or accurate as what you now expect every device on the market to offer. Once it was possible to put a single lead ECG in a watch, there were no new health-tracking worlds left to conquer that didn’t involve breaking the skin.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Dr. Audrey Bowden is Dorothy J. Wingfield Philips Chancellor Faculty Fellow, Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt University, and head of the <a href="https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/bowdenlab/">Bowden Biomedical Optics Laboratory</a>. Dr. Bowden tells Engadget that clinical urinalysis is used as a “first line screening for many diseases and conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease,” but added that it can “also play a role in ordinary, routine checkups, such as during pregnancy.”</p><p>You may have seen your physician ask you for a urine sample and then stir a <a href="https://webpath.med.utah.edu/TUTORIAL/URINE/URINE.html">dipstick</a> dotted with colored squares of reaction paper into the liquid you’ve just produced. In addition to visually checking urine for cloudiness (an obvious sign of a problem), these squares can run a wide variety of tests as part of this first-line screening process.</p><p>Each square corresponds to a different test, looking for factors like pH as well as the presence of blood, or white blood cells. Blood, for instance, can indicate kidney stones or cancer, while white blood cells are a clue your body is fighting an infection. If there’s excess glucose in the urine, it’s likely that diabetes is the culprit. Ketones would indicate ketosis, nitrites could indicate bacteria in the urinary tract, and so on.</p><p>Dr. Bowden added that for many conditions, urinalysis is not a “definitive diagnostic, but rather serves as an initial prompt to perform a more complete investigation.” And that since the clinical procedure has been to test for urine when there’s already evidence of a problem, it’s not clear how effective daily testing can really be.</p><p>A medical professional I interviewed, who requested anonymity for fear of compromising their professional standing, expressed skepticism both about the accuracy of these tests as well as their utility. They said that if people were running tests at home on a regular basis, it runs the risk of providing hypochondriacs with another reason to clog up care centers.</p><p>Dr. Shubha K. De (MD) is a Urologic surgeon who is presently working on a PhD in biomedical engineering. He raised a concern that, in primary care facilities, medical staff know how to validate the data they’re presented with, and to screen out false positives. This may not be the case in an at-home setting, and added that the accuracy of some tests vary wildly — a dipstick test to identify a bladder infection is roughly 80-percent accurate, but to diagnose bladder cancer, it falls to just 3 percent.</p><p>The most talked-about gadget at CES is surely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-u-scan-urine-monitoring-device-ces-2023-010057961.html">Withings’ U-Scan</a>, which even Jimmy Kimmel joked about in his <a href="https://youtu.be/wNeIUfsmEro?t=486">opening monologue</a> on Thursday. Given that Withings is already such a big name in the health-tracking world, it’s little surprise that it’s hogged the attention. The company showed off a device that sits on the dry part of your toilet bowl, and samples some of your trickle as you pee. Once that fluid is captured inside the device, it runs a sample through a microfluidic cartridge (with reaction paper) and uses a reader to look at the result. Once completed, the results are sent to your phone, with suggestions on what you might do to improve your health.</p><p>When it’s eventually released, U-Scan will offer a cartridge for menstrual cycle tracking, as well as one to monitor your hydration and nutrition levels. It’s this latter cartridge I tried during my time in Vegas this week, and it looked at the pH of my urine as well as the specific gravity (relative density) of my pee. But the company promises that it will eventually be able to identify nutrient levels, fat metabolism, ketones and quantities of vitamin C.</p><p>Both of these have raised red flags with professionals who are concerned that these analyses don’t suit a one-size-fits-all model. Dr. Bowden said that menstrual cycle tracking based on “‘normalization’ curves may have been developed with too narrow a demographic to capture all interested users.”</p><p>Dr. Bowden was also resistant to the idea that nutritional information can be extracted given clinical urinalysis doesn’t offer data about those markers. She said urine samples don’t really “provide reliable information over a given time window,” and added that a “daily analysis of food nutritional content may be a stretch.” Although she did say that it may be possible to detect “accumulated nutritional deficits.”</p><p>Dr. De, however, says that it may be possible to extrapolate nutritional information back to a person’s diet using urine analysis. They said that physicians currently ask patients to run 24-hour urine collections, and that fluid is then examined for specific substances — like uric acid — to make inferences on dietary intake. “This is not always perfect, and currently needs some correlation with one’s diet history,” but added that it’s plausible to imagine that, with a “user friendly app and some AI” that it could work well.</p><p>Withings is looking to develop more clinical tests, and has said that it’s already working on a way to screen for bladder cancer markers. It’s here that my source who asked not to be named feels would offer real value to groups who are at risk of the disease. They said that a targeted monitoring program may help identify instances of the cancer early, which should dramatically increase survival rates.</p><figure><img alt="Image of Yellosis' Cym Seat urine analysis device." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/8b5c7bd0-8e08-11ed-bedb-41e2190f3c53" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Korean company Yellosis graduated from Samsung’s startup incubator some years ago, and already produces the Cym Boat personal urine testing kit. Cym Boat offers a small stick with reaction paper squares, which you then stand in a boat-shaped piece of card lined with color-calibration squares. Take a picture on your smartphone, and you’ll be able to look at the blood, protein, ketones, pH and glucose levels within your urine.</p><p>At the show, it also showed off its next-generation product, Cym Seat, which uses a metal arm to hold a paper stick under a person as they pee. Once completed, it slides the strip in front of an optical scanner, and after a minute, the results are pushed to your phone. But this device, which is expected to launch by the end of 2023 and cost around $1,000, automates the existing process rather than adding anything new.</p><figure><img alt="Image of Vivoo's toilet-mounted urine analysis device." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/cc960620-8e08-11ed-bcfb-80b4d4c84d6b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivoo-smart-toilet-clip-on-device-urine-test-190518742.html">Vivoo</a>, which also offers a reaction-paper stick which can be analyzed by a smartphone app, is building its own toilet-mounted hardware, which pushes a pee stick into the toilet bowl and then pulls it back in once it’s collected a urine sample.

The potential for such a technology is far greater than reaction paper, and there are some <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cclm-2020-0524/html?lang=en">studies</a> that have pointed to being able to identify infection with it.</p><p>Olive is presently being used in a handful of locations in the Netherlands, including an assisted living facility. Co-founder Corey Katz told Engadget that one of the most surprising uses for the technology was for personnel to keep accurate records of patient bathroom visits. Katz added that work is presently under way to find a way to measure levels of protein in urine to identify instances of preeclampsia.</p><p>The company says that there’s a broad number of conditions that spectroscopy could be used to test for. This includes hydration and ketosis all the way through to stress, creatinine levels and electrolyte balances. The hope is that a finished version of the hardware will be ready to go by the end of 2023, although it’ll only be sold to business customers.</p><p>There are issues, including around data security, especially for menstrual cycle tracking in countries like the US.

Dr. Bowden raised concerns that urinalysis tests can be “impacted by a number of external factors,” which clinical settings make an effort to control for. Will these devices be accurate enough for the jobs they’ve been bought to do? And will the conclusions they provide be worthwhile? There’s a lot to work through before these products become ubiquitous in bathrooms around the world.</p>

<p>Samsung may have inadvertently confirmed that it will unveil its next flagship phones early next month. According to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/01/06/galaxy-s23-launch-date-leak/"><em>9to5Google</em></a>, the company's <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vY28vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxNzcyZGQ4My0zNTIzLTQ5ZTMtYjA5ZC05OTlkOTRlYWVlYmEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAajjx8zp5iq2xIuVXN9SgPxRIjHVQXdxaYNtQNgXjka8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fco%2F">Colombian website</a> has published a page revealing that its next Galaxy Unpacked event is scheduled for February 1st, 2023. "Epic moments are approaching," it read, based on the publication's screenshot of the page, which is now no longer viewable on the website. While the announcement didn't explicitly say that the event will officially introduce the Galaxy S23, it shows the flagship series' expected triple-camera setup.&nbsp;</p><p>As the publication notes, the leaves and flowers in the borders of the teaser reflect the colors of the <a href="https://twitter.com/_snoopytech_/status/1611086652629213205">leaked renders</a> that seemed to show Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23 Ultra units in green and lilac. Previous reports also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-debut-galaxy-s-23-february-133502295.html">suggested</a> that we'll get to see the upcoming phones in the first week of February at an Unpacked event, which is likely to take place in San Francisco. In addition, an early February Unpacked for the flagship series is consistent with previous unveilings: For the Galaxy S22 series, Samsung <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-unpacked-news-181636961.html">held an event</a> on February 9th, 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="93a9d970b815417fa130317517686bc0"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Breaking！<br />Galaxy S23 series , February 1st! <a href="https://t.co/ACKfp8hFLC">pic.twitter.com/ACKfp8hFLC</a></p>— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1611549591144628224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Samsung is reportedly ditching its Exynos chips and using Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC to power all the Galaxy S23 units sold worldwide. The Korean tech giant typically equips its Asian and European releases with Exynos chipsets, while units sold in the US come with Qualcomm processors. Other reports suggested that the Galaxy S23 will have a <a href="https://english.etnews.com/20220509200001">200-megapixel</a> main camera, while the base S23 and Galaxy S23 Plus models will come with a 50-megapixel main shooter. If the leaked Unpacked page is accurate, we won't have to wait long to know for sure.</p>
