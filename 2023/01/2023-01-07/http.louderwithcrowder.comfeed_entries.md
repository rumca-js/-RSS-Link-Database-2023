	It's already been established that there was a deliberate over-counting of COVID deaths by US health authorities. 
	<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/florida-man-killed-crash-listed-covid-19-death-raising-doubts-over-health-data-1518994" target="_blank">Stories</a> of people dying in car crashes, but being labeled a "COVID death" fueled "cOnSpIrAcY theories" early on in the pandemic until <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-cdc-director" target="_blank">Rochelle Walensky</a> just came out and said it was true a year and a half later.
</p><p>
	There was 
	<a href="https://sfstandard.com/technology/these-doctors-pushed-masking-covid-lockdowns-on-twitter-turns-out-they-dont-exist/" target="_blank">another</a> method in place to make the pandemic seem worse than it was, and this one was even more bizarre--a Twitter network of transgender doctors who claimed to have patients die of COVID...except all the doctors were fake.
</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cOn Twitter there existed an entire network of supposed ER doctors who identified as part of the trans community who constantly lost patients to COVID & received thousands of retweets.

<p>
	One example was Dr. Robert Honeyman who claimed to have lost his/her/zher sister to COVID and tweeted about it, garnering 4,000 retweets and 43,000 likes. A month later, Honeyman wrote that his husband had fallen into a COVID-induced coma: "Sad to announce that my husband has entered a coma after being in hospital with Covid. The doctor is unsure if he will come out. This year has been the toughest of my life losing my sister to this virus. This is the first time in my life I don’t see light at the end of the tunnel.”

	Honeyman's profile picture was taken from a royalty-free image side and titled, "smiling happy, handsome Latino man outside," and his bio includes the Ukrainian and Transgender flags. His apparently comatose husband's photo was actually an insurance professional in Indiana.

	Other tweets on Honeyman's profile encourage stringent lockdown and COVID mitigation measures:

	The other doctors in the network also expressed pro-LGBTQAEIPP-2S opinions. It seems the strategy was to market lefty, doctors to try and rally other like-minded individuals to push for stricter COVID measures.

Yesterday was Tomi Lahren saying she won't take one. This is exactly why I want to know what 'reduction' actually looks like- if 'reduction' means 'pumping our most vaccine-hesitant audience with Tucker Carlson saying it doesn't work' then...I'm not sure it's reduction!" </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Back in 2021, Tucker Carlson claimed to have evidence from a whistleblower that the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/undertaker-twitter-parody" target="_blank">FBI</a> and NSA were monitoring his show. He was widely mocked and "debunked" by the left...but is this so far-fetched, now knowing the White House was monitoring his content? </p><p>The NSA issued a statement denying that Tucker was a target, but dodged around whether or not Tucker was being spied on.

<p>Back in May, Landry and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued the Biden administration over alleged collusion with social media companies to suppress speech about COVID and the 2020 Presidential election.

## Watch: Kevin McCarthy gets elected Speaker (finally), so of course CNN claims all involved are 'insurrectionist'

## Watch: Ron DeSantis fan hits Gavin Newsom with harsh reality check during his inauguration

</p><p>In all honesty? <em>IF</em> we had Ron DeSantis vs Gavin Newsom running for president, I think it would be great for America. Joe Biden vs. Donald Trump will be about one thing: Trump. Biden will campaign on "ORANGE MAN BAD." Trump will campaign on how everyone is unfair and mean to Trump.</p><p>Newsom vs. DeSantis? There isn't a more-perfect debate between the two competing ideologies in America. BOTH represent states where those two ideologies have been put into action and he can see clear results to compare. America can be more like Florida. Or America can be more like California. </p><p>Now have the two governors crisscross the country and make the case to the American people. In a perfect world, we'd get the national debate the country needs.</p><p><p>

If you're going to hold up a restaurant, you should never use a fake gun. If you're going to hold up a restaurant with a fake gun, only a total nincompoop would do so in Texas. For one knucklehead, he learned this lesson the hard way.</p><p>Worse, he held up a taqueria. People trying to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jill-biden-tacos-journalist" target="_blank">enjoy their tacos</a> and queso and chimichangas. And this dinkus walks in with a fake gun and is all like "this is a hold up" because nothing is sacred.</p><p>Spoiler: he's dead now. Because again, fake gun + Texas = <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lady-gaga-texas" target="_blank">do you even know Texas</a>, bro?</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">💥 stay strapped <a href="https://t.co/Gt49u5vBMH">pic.twitter.com/Gt49u5vBMH</a><br />— Clown World ™ 🤡 (@ClownWorld_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClownWorld_/status/1611562700462772225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/crime/taqueria-robbery-shooting-houston/285-5dceec19-9c07-444c-b211-4c584738e0fa" target="_blank">KHOU-11 reports</a> the man with the real gun did not know the man with a fake gun...had a fake gun. This is why it is inadvisable that, if you make the regretful decision to commit armed robbery, you need to focus on the armed part more than the robbery part. It shouldn't be too much to expect criminals to think these things through. Yet here we all are again.</p><p>This part is my favorite.</p><blockquote>The shooter collected the stolen money from the robber and returned it to the other patrons, police said. Then the rest of the people in the restaurant left the scene before the police arrived.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The gun-toting hero took the stolen money off of the robber's soon-to-be corpse, handed it back to the patrons, and everyone just got up and left. Everyone, except for the employees who now needed to Google how to get blood out of grout.</p><p>Investigators would like to ask the shooter a few questions. He is not being charged with anything at the time. According to Texas penal (tee-hee) code, "whether someone uses deadly force in the situation, that is presumed to be correct under Texas law." Though I'm sure authorities still have some loose ends and paperwork to tie up.</p><p><p>
