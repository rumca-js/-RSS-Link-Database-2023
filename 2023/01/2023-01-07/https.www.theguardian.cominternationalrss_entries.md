<p>In a series of short essays, writers consider what happiness means to them now, after the reckoning of the past few years</p><p>The North Head of Sydney Harbour, named Car-rang-gel according to the Sydney Northern Beaches clan, happens to be my book of daily delights. My wife and compadre, Judy, loves this great block of fissured sandstone and heath above the Pacific too. She’s angry at me when I write about it because she fears the place may become too popular for its good. Its coastal heath went up in prodigious flames above the sea two years back, in a fire of such latter-day intensity many thought there would be no regeneration on this plateau of vistas. But it’s all come back, a little differently.</p><p>The flannel flowers, the glorious punks that eschew polite gardens and only grow on depleted sandy headlands and in the face of salt gales, have asserted themselves and are now visually dominant. Their lovely green-tipped white petals feel just like flannel, a trick that fascinates children, and me for that matter. Then the <em>banksia serrata</em>, are back with their gloried big candles, the ones that shine with nectar and attract rainbow lorikeets before degenerating into furry Daleks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/08/thomas-keneally-at-north-head-i-hear-the-song-of-the-dead-and-relish-my-place-in-the-human-stream">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The award-winning poet on his painful and funny new memoir about growing up in Dundee, how he’s a ‘vile separatist’ and why music is his first love</p><p><a href="http://donpaterson.net/">Don Paterson</a>, 59, is one of our most outstanding poets, a winner of the Whitbread poetry prize, the Costa poetry award, all three Forward prizes, the TS Eliot prize (twice), and the Queen’s gold medal for poetry. He is about to publish <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/toy-fights-9780571240272">Toy Fights</a></em>, a memoir of his life up to the age of 20. The book should carry a warning: anyone wanting a quiet book should read elsewhere – it will make you laugh aloud. It describes growing up on a Dundee council estate, an unruly school life and the beginnings of his obsession with music (Paterson was later a guitarist with the Celtic-influenced, Euro-jazz band Lammas). His gloriously gnarled humour never upstages seriousness, particularly in his account of a psychiatric breakdown as an adolescent, recalled with unself-pitying precision.</p><p><strong>Can you explain why this memoir has been years in the writing?<br /></strong>I lost interest in myself – and in autobiographical writing – unfortunately after the book had been commissioned [laughs]. But after my father died, three years ago, I had a sudden blast of perspective that helped; made it seem more necessary.</p><p><em>Toy Fights </em>by Don Paterson is published by Faber (£16.99).

<p><a href="https://instagram.com/isopresso_balloon">Masayoshi Matsumoto</a> was working as a chemical engineer when he first learned how to make balloon animals. Matsumoto doesn’t use marker pens or tape for details on his creations: every eyeball, feather and claw is made from balloons. Inspired by wildlife photography, his menagerie of creatures includes startlingly detailed hermit crabs, baboons, ants and birds. He says the most difficult animal to make is a pangolin. “Many people imagine a poodle or such when they hear the term balloon art,” he says, “but I would like people to realise that you can create complex works too.”</p><p><em>See more at <a href="http://instagram.com/isopresso_balloon">instagram.com/isopresso_balloon</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/jan/07/balloon-animals-beyond-the-poodle-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former president faces the prospect of political irrelevance. But the lasting damage he has done is evident in the chaotic scenes in Congress</p><p>“It’s just drama,” sighed Jaime Herrera Beutler last Wednesday as the new Republican majority in Congress repeatedly fumbled its first automatic obligation, taking 15 votes to elect a speaker. Beutler herself took no part in the posturing and play-acting. Having voted in favour of impeaching Donald Trump after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/trump-capitol-american-carnage-washington">the riot at the Capitol on 6 January 2021</a>, she missed her chance for re-election when Trump pushed one of his loyalists to challenge her.</p><p>The Trumpist ousted Beutler in a run-off, then lost to a Democrat in the general election: Trump had his petty revenge, for which the Republicans paid. Though he continues to whip up drama, he has lost his capacity to direct it, and so the unscripted, absurdly improvised drama reels on – in the short term comic but, as it confounds the country’s government, in the long run probably tragic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/07/two-years-on-from-the-capitol-riot-the-toxic-legacy-of-trumps-big-lie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Golf is all too often seen as attracting a certain sort of player. But when I started to learn, I was soon welcomed into the club</p><p>Ping! My driver connects with the golf ball and the sweet, sharp noise is accompanied by the joy of seeing my ball soar through the air. This is my new favourite sound… and the bliss? That can often be as short-lived as the walk to my next shot, but I’m getting used to the highs and lows of my latest addiction. I love playing 18 holes at the golf course. Sometimes I can’t believe that since the end of February 2021, I have already racked up many, many more hours playing golf than I’d like to admit. </p><p>I’ve never had a hobby before. As someone who has always enjoyed working a little too much – I’m an author, broadcaster and consultant – playing Candy Crush on my phone was my idea of letting off steam.

<p>I jumped at the chance to interview her, but regretted it almost at once after being reminded of a bad review I wrote</p><p>When I heard that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/04/writer-fay-weldon-dies-aged-91">Fay Weldon</a> had died, I thought of those great early-ish novels, <em>Praxis</em> and <em>Puffball</em>, and of how much I enjoyed them as a teenager. Looking at my old Coronet paperbacks, I see something I didn’t recognise at the time: her stylistic innovation. Both are written in shards, brief paragraphs that float apart from one another in white space – the same technique now used by (among other writers) the very modish Jenny Offill.</p><p>Twenty years ago, I was dispatched to interview Weldon at home in Hampstead, north London. Her then husband, Nick, answered the door and immediately began a brutal interrogation. My name sounded familiar. Hadn’t I given Fay’s novel <em>The Bulgari Connection</em>, a book controversially sponsored by the Italian jeweller, a stinking review? Uh oh. But I wasn’t about to confess: I had a job to do. Was it definitely me he was thinking of? And was the review <em>really</em> a stinker? Maybe marital loyalty had made it seem worse than it was.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/07/i-learned-the-hard-way-that-fay-weldon-was-as-sharp-witted-as-her-characters">Continue reading...</a>

The area had made a lasting impression on the couple almost 10 years previously when Macnair’s father had led them on a cycling expedition that skirted the south side of the loch. “The beauty of the landscape hit us both,” Macnair recalls.</p><p>Years later – married with two kids and living in London – the young family were on holiday on the Isle of Mull when Neil saw an ad for a field with planning permission. “We weren’t particularly thinking of doing anything like this,” says Macnair, “but we had such lovely memories of the area. On the drive back home, we took a detour to go and see it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/07/loch-living-a-beautiful-home-on-the-banks-of-the-tay">Continue reading...</a>

## The ChatGPT bot is causing panic now – but it’ll soon be as mundane a tool as Excel | John Naughton

<p>A new AI-assisted chatbot that can generate eerily fluent prose is only the latest in a long series of useful tech accessories</p><p>So the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a> language processing model burst upon an astonished world and the air was rent by squeals of delight and cries of outrage or lamentation. The delighted ones were those transfixed by discovering that a machine could apparently carry out a written commission competently. The outrage was triggered by fears of redundancy on the part of people whose employment requires the ability to write workmanlike prose. And the lamentations came from earnest folks (many of them teachers at various levels) whose day jobs involve grading essays hitherto written by students.</p><p>So far, so predictable. If we know anything from history, it is that we generally overestimate the short-term impact of new communication technologies, while grossly underestimating their long-term implications. So it was with print, movies, broadcast radio and television and the internet. And I suspect we have just jumped on to the same cognitive merry-go-round.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/07/chatgpt-bot-excel-ai-chatbot-tech">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(HighNote)<br />The saxophonist and his top band eschew improvisation in favour of faithful renditions of classic tunes, from Cole Porter to Paul Anka</p><p>There aren’t many of them about in the jazz world these days, but the American tenor saxophonist Houston Person is undoubtedly a melody man. He likes to keep close to the tune and relishes a real slow ballad. Oddly enough, he doesn’t play it with the customary warm vibrato. In fact there’s hardly any vibrato at all, but his slightly husky tone holds your attention like an instrumental Nat King Cole. Person is also a noted record producer and has been around long enough to know exactly who to choose when setting up a band.</p><p>Guitarist Russell Malone is probably the best known here, but look up the others and you’ll see they’re all in the A team: Larry Fuller (piano), Matthew Parrish (bass) and Lewis Nash (drums). Having chosen them, Person makes sure that each one gets his fair share of the limelight, and there’s some great playing all round on these 10 tracks. The songwriters chosen stretch from Cole Porter to Percy Mayfield. If I had to choose one number it would be Paul Anka’s Put Your Head on My Shoulder, played with such delicacy that I keep going back to hear it again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/07/houston-person-reminiscing-at-rudys-review-a-melody-masterclass">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Carla Simón’s powerful drama of a battle to save an ancestral peach farm from redevelopment is given added potency by nonprofessional actors</p><p>It’s more than a piece of land. A thriving peach farm in the rural heartland of Catalonia is also the fertile earth that sustains multiple generations of an extended family. It’s the repository of the stories passed down from weathered grannies in funereal black cardigans to each fresh branch of an ever-spreading ancestral tree. It’s the launchpad for games of imagination for Iris (Ainet Jounou) and her semi-feral twin cousins. It’s a perpetual battleground: the men patrol at night with shotguns and spotlights, alert for rabbit incursions into the orchards. And it’s on borrowed time.</p><p>At the start of Carla Simón’s terrific second feature (her first was the equally impressive 2017 drama <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/14/summer-1993-review-moving-childhood-loss">Summer 1993</a></em>) a bombshell drops: after the death of his father, the new owner of the land does not intend to honour the gentleman’s agreement that permitted the family to cultivate it for the last three generations. They can keep their house, he says. But after this year’s harvest, the trees will be grubbed out and replaced by solar panels. It’s such a devastating blow that it’s hard for the family members to comprehend.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/07/alcarras-review-carla-simon-angry-urgent-fight-for-family-land-in-catalonia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To slate-grey north Kent, and the latest rickety stop on the Leicester redemption tour. If Kent is the garden of England, then Gillingham is the unloved bit round the back of the garden shed, consisting of a pile of bricks, a broken child’s tricycle and several soaking cardboard boxes. For Brendan Rodgers’s ailing side, this felt like the perfect spot for an ambush. In the event disaster was averted, but little else.</p><p>Kelechi Iheanacho delivered the goods early in the second half, maintaining a remarkable scoring record in the FA Cup. This was his 16th goal, moving him level on the all-time competition list with the likes of Roger Hunt and Robbie Fowler. And though there were few alarms for the 2021 winners as they saw out their slender lead, there was precious little to cheer them either: lots of pointless possession, a distinct lack of ideas and numerous abortive diagonal passes. A better opponent might have caused them real problems.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/07/gillingham-leicester-fa-cup-third-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Labour doesn’t seem to understand how it’s happening’: meet the new Black Tories

<p>The Conservatives are keen to boast about the diversity of their top team – but the party has never been seen as a natural home for Black voters. Can a small group of Black Tories change that?</p><p>History is unlikely to be kind to Kwasi Kwarteng’s 38-day tenure as Britain’s first Black chancellor. Almost overnight, his disastrous mini-budget tanked the economy, crashed the pound and sent interest rates soaring. Three weeks later, he was gone. But there is no denying the symbolic power of the brief moment last autumn when there were no white men occupying any of the four great offices of state.<br /><br />Kwarteng, who was born in east London to Ghanaian parents was the fourth consecutive person of colour to hold the post of chancellor. James Cleverly, whose mother hails from Sierra Leone, became the country’s first Black foreign secretary. Suella Braverman, the daughter of a Kenyan of Christian Goan origin and a Mauritian of Indian origin, was the third home secretary of colour in a row, while Kemi Badenoch, who was born in south-west London to Nigerian parents, became trade secretary. Perhaps most notable of all was that this new era of diversity at the top of government had been delivered not by Labour, the party traditionally seen as the natural home for minority voters, but by the Conservatives.</p><p>In the wake of the fallout from his mini-budget, Kwarteng derided the opposition’s record on diversity. “If you look at the last 10 years, the Conservative party is much more ethnically diverse than the Labour party, and they lecture us on diversity. They lecture us on gender diversity when they’ve never had a female leader; we’ve had three female prime ministers,” <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11270617/Kwasi-Kwarteng-says-wrong-sort-black-man-Labour.html">he told the Mail on Sunday</a>. “So, on gender, on race, on all of these things they think they own, they are failing and are backward, and the Conservative party is much more progressive.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/07/new-black-tories-labour-doesnt-seem-to-understand-how-its-happening">Continue reading...</a>

For all these reasons, it’s my first recipe for 2023. Even if you don’t need it now, treat it more like a tool you can whip out for when you do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/07/vegan-celery-congee-with-braised-mushrooms-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

## Kumail Nanjiani: ‘For my new role I ate fried chicken, french fries, doughnuts … it was less fun than I imagined’

<p>The comic actor raised eyebrows with his muscle-bound look for his role in Marvel’s Eternals. Now he’s gone the opposite way to play the sleazy founder of the Chippendales</p><p>At 44, the comic and actor Kumail Nanjiani is best known for playing different versions of himself. His 2017 breakthrough in the Oscar-nominated romcom The Big Sick saw him act out his early romance with his wife, Emily Gordon, as she became seriously ill, while his wry, self-effacing routines made him a recognisable name on the US standup circuit through referencing his upbringing in Pakistan and reckoning with his identity as a Muslim American. Even his debut TV role as the coder Dinesh in six seasons of the comedy series Silicon Valley saw him draw on his early 20s experiences of working in IT.</p><p>On screen, Nanjiani is wise-cracking, nerdy and prone to fits of fast-talking awkwardness. He is Hugh Grant from Four Weddings and a Funeral – one of Nanjiani’s favourite films – repackaged with an American accent, a plaid shirt and a pair of jeans. In real life, though, he seems to be none of that. Speaking over a video call from his LA home, Nanjiani is chisel-jawed and self-assured, taking his time to respond with a considered seriousness. It all points to a recent change – on and off camera – resulting in a new role that takes him far from his own life and into the seedy world of 80s nightlife, playing the founder of the male stripping franchise the Chippendales.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/07/kumail-nanjiani-welcome-to-chippendales-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## The outsider: why Katherine Mansfield still divides opinion 100 years after her death

<p>Shunned by the Bloomsbury group, Katherine Mansfield was one of the 20th century’s most fearless and funny writers. And she paid dearly for the freedoms she claimed</p><p>How and why did Katherine Mansfield provoke such violent extremes of admiration and hostility, both during her life and after it? Fifty years after her death, the BBC television series A Picture of Katherine Mansfield gave a fair example of her reputation in 1973. Tall, intense Vanessa Redgrave played Mansfield; short, baffled Annette Crosbie her devoted dogsbody friend Ida Baker (known as LM), with Jeremy Brett as Mansfield’s husband John Middleton Murry taking off his glasses whenever he had to express emotional inadequacy – which was frequently. In an accompanying Radio Times interview, the 85-year-old LM, literal-minded to the end, said the series hadn’t seemed realistic to her as Katherine had been shorter than her; <em>she</em> had been the tall one. (One of Mansfield’s less than kind nicknames for LM had been The Mountain.) The biopic broadly followed Murry’s drive to establish his late wife as a sort of secular saint and her final wish to make something visionary of her death, which enraged those who had known her and perplexed new readers who had found her work funny and beautiful before coming into contact with the myth.</p><p>A flock of biographies followed, the finest two presenting startlingly different portraits of Mansfield. New Zealander Antony Alpers’s epic 1980 life was sympathetic to the point of avuncular. The reader cannot but flinch at his account of the passionate gifted girl launching herself thousands of miles from home on a handful of Oscar Wilde’s least helpful aphorisms. In an early notebook she had copied out “Push everything as far as it can go”, and “The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it” and so on (with her own, too, written in imitation: “Never relight a dead cigarette or an old passion”).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/07/the-outsider-why-katherine-mansfield-divided-opinion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Watching Nick Kyrgios and other ‘next generation’ stars, life on tour resembles a nightmare more than living the dream</p><p>Nick Kyrgios is a professional tennis player, one of the best in the world. He has an adoring girlfriend, Costeen Hatzi, and an amiable sidekick called “Horse” , as well as thousands of fans in the stands to cheer his winning shots. But it is still not enough – probably, it never quite is. “Tennis is an extremely lonely sport,” he says. “That’s what I struggle with the most.”</p><p>For better or worse, Kyrgios looks set to land a fresh load of fans with the release of the Netflix series Break Point, a 10-part docusoap that follows the fortunes of the so-called “next generation” of tennis stars; the band of twentysomething athletes who have been challenging Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

<p>Female workers tell of exploitation and sexual assault at frankincense warehouse supplying US essential oils company</p><p>“I’m not speaking metaphorically – a bottle of doTERRA essential oil can change the world,” says David Stirling, a mild, clean-cut, middle-aged man. His largely female audience cheers and whistles, as if for a celebrity. Stirling, then CEO and co-founder of doTERRA, a Utah-based multi-level marketing company that sells essential oils, is making his opening remarks in September 2021 to the packed Salt Palace Convention Center in Salt Lake City.</p><p>In a setting reminiscent of a megachurch, Stirling’s soft-spoken voice echoes. He reminds the audience that the world needs healers more than ever – “and that’s you”, he says, to raucous applause. He quotes CS Lewis, speaks of miracles and says he’s seen people turn to doTERRA in their lowest moments.

<p>If your hair is bleached, heat damaged, weakened or breaking off at the ends, prepare yourself for a miracle…</p><p>Can damaged, breaking hair be repaired by anything other than scissors? Until three months ago, I’d have scoffed at the idea. Now, if I had the faintest inkling of how to buy shares, I’d go large on haircare company Living Proof. In my view, its new <strong><a href="https://www.livingproof.co.uk/triple-bond/triple-bond-complex/03131.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyracBhDoARIsACGFcS4V_2iu_jpM0eV7XIrngZy32uj7vjy-rLv9pMNU7d_IyG3av252DBAaAkFPEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" title="">Triple Bond Complex</a> </strong>is the most exciting development in haircare in a decade.</p><p>It’s a non-greasy cream containing a plant-derived ester (chemical compound) that can penetrate hair and rebuild all three types of damaged bonds in the fibres.

<p>Gianluca Vialli gave me my first-team debut in 1998 and made everyone at Chelsea feel like they were his friend</p><p>Whenever you mention Luca – and he was Luca to us all at Chelsea – people just smile. He gave me my debut as an 18-year-old in 1998 when he was player-manager and at a time when there was no certainty I would get it. But you ask anyone from that youth team, even those who did not get their chance under him, and they will all say the same thing: that they loved him. He was special. Nobody will ever find a bad word to say about Luca.</p><p>Luca made everyone feel like they were his friend. And there were probably thousands of people who felt that way, even those who only met him once. At the old Harlington training ground, every first-team player would have to walk down the corridor and pass the youth team changing room and he was one of the few who would always stick his head in and say: “Good morning, chaps.” He knew everyone’s name.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/07/gianluca-vialli-jon-harley-chelsea-manager">Continue reading...</a>

He noticed my surname was Italian and said: “I’m a-glad-a you won,” which became a family catchphrase. I was king of the neighbourhood that year, and I’ve never properly thanked my sister for doing the actual colouring-in. Thanks, Anne. <br /><strong>Pete Accini, 55, Brisbane, Australia</strong> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/07/it-was-the-mk2-i-dreamed-of-readers-recall-their-raleigh-chopper-rides">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She’s the anti-poverty campaigner and food writer who shot to fame by teaching us how to make the most of our pennies. But behind the scenes her world was unravelling</p><p>A car calls at Jack Monroe’s home in Southend to take her to the photoshoot at noon. Nobody appears to be in. The driver rings the bell and calls her mobile. Nothing. 12.30pm. More ringing, more calling. Still nothing. 1pm. Her agent tries her. Then her publisher, then her former girlfriend. Still nothing. 1.30pm. We call off the shoot, and the car leaves. Everybody is beginning to panic. Where is she?</p><p>At 2pm, Monroe wakes up and looks at her phone. She sees all the missed calls – and the time. Now it’s her turn to panic. She calls her agent, apologises like crazy, and makes her own way to London. Two hours later, she’s lying in a bath of pennies for the photoshoot, still apologising. “Every single one of those people trying to get in touch with me thought I’d relapsed. My AA sponsor came round and tried to get me up, but I just couldn’t wake. The first thing I did was ring my sponsor and say, ‘I promise to God I haven’t relapsed.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/07/jack-monroe-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>OK, it’s not all that like bacon, but ‘bananacon’ or ‘facon’ is easy, flavourful and interesting to eat</p><p>As a cook and food lover, I thrive off new ingredients and techniques. Food movements such as zero-waste cooking, plant-based eating and even health fads, even if some are questionable, often push boundaries, creating new and innovative foods, some of which lead to the discovery of intriguing and welcome new flavour experiences.</p><p>If I’m being honest, banana skin “bacon” (or bananacon or facon, as some people call it) isn’t all that similar to bacon, but it is delicious, interesting and fun; it’s also really easy to make. The most important thing is to use organic bananas, to avoid pesticides and fungicides. The second most important thing is that your banana skins are super-ripe, with large brown spots, which will guarantee a sweeter end result.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/07/how-to-turn-over-ripe-banana-skins-into-bacon-recipe-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>
