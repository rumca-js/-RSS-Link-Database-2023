Can a small group of Black Tories change that?</p><p>History is unlikely to be kind to Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s 38-day tenure as Britain\u2019s first Black chancellor. Almost overnight, his disastrous mini-budget tanked the economy, crashed the pound and sent interest rates soaring. Three weeks later, he was gone. But there is no denying the symbolic power of the brief moment last autumn when there were no white men occupying any of the four great offices of state.<br /><br />Kwarteng, who was born in east London to Ghanaian parents was the fourth consecutive person of colour to hold the post of chancellor. James Cleverly, whose mother hails from Sierra Leone, became the country\u2019s first Black foreign secretary. Suella Braverman, the daughter of a Kenyan of Christian Goan origin and a Mauritian of Indian origin, was the third home secretary of colour in a row, while Kemi Badenoch, who was born in south-west London to Nigerian parents, became trade secretary. Perhaps most notable of all was that this new era of diversity at the top of government had been delivered not by Labour, the party traditionally seen as the natural home for minority voters, but by the Conservatives.</p><p>In the wake of the fallout from his mini-budget, Kwarteng derided the opposition\u2019s record on diversity. \u201cIf you look at the last 10 years, the Conservative party is much more ethnically diverse than the Labour party, and they lecture us on diversity.

And she paid dearly for the freedoms she claimed</p><p>How and why did Katherine Mansfield provoke such violent extremes of admiration and hostility, both during her life and after it? Fifty years after her death, the BBC television series A Picture of Katherine Mansfield gave a fair example of her reputation in 1973. Tall, intense Vanessa Redgrave played Mansfield; short, baffled Annette Crosbie her devoted dogsbody friend Ida Baker (known as LM), with Jeremy Brett as Mansfield\u2019s husband John Middleton Murry taking off his glasses whenever he had to express emotional inadequacy \u2013 which was frequently. In an accompanying Radio Times interview, the 85-year-old LM, literal-minded to the end, said the series hadn\u2019t seemed realistic to her as Katherine had been shorter than her; <em>she</em> had been the tall one. (One of Mansfield\u2019s less than kind nicknames for LM had been The Mountain.) The biopic broadly followed Murry\u2019s drive to establish his late wife as a sort of secular saint and her final wish to make something visionary of her death, which enraged those who had known her and perplexed new readers who had found her work funny and beautiful before coming into contact with the myth.</p><p>A flock of biographies followed, the finest two presenting startlingly different portraits of Mansfield. New Zealander Antony Alpers\u2019s epic 1980 life was sympathetic to the point of avuncular.
