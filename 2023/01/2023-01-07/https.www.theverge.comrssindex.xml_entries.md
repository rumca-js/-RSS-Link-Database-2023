  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="685j3W">The first wirelessly powered smart deadbolt is launching later this year — but you’ll have to wait for the wireless power. The Alfred DB2S is the first DIY-installable smart lock that can charge via infrared power transmission, and Alfred says it’ll be available for $299 at The Home Depot, Lowe’s, and other retailers in early Q2.</p>
<p id="B6jrvB">There’s a slight catch, though: that $299 doesn’t get you wireless charging, at least not yet. For that, you’ll need a <a href="https://www.wi-charge.com/">Wi-Charge</a> charging kit, which won’t be available through consumer channels until the second half of 2023 at the earliest. Pricing for the kit has not been set. </p>

  <p id="cexy2H">One of the companies working on smart contact lenses is calling the project off. On Friday, Mojo Vision <a href="https://www.mojo.vision/news/a-new-direction">announced</a> that it’s going to “pivot its business and focus its resources” on the MicroLED display tech it built during its work on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21067683/mojo-smart-contact-lens-augmented-reality-startup">the Mojo Lens</a> (<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/06/smart-contact-lens-startup-mojo-vision-layoffs">via <em>Axios</em></a>). Unfortunately, part of the pivot includes laying off around 75 percent of its workers as it restructures, according to a news post from the company’s CEO, Drew Perkins. The company had around 150 employees, according to data from <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/234558-01#overview">PitchBook</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mojovision/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p id="N1V0Fk">The post says the reason for the change is that Mojo hasn’t been able to keep raising money to work on its smart contact lens. “The slumping global economy, extremely tight capital markets, and the yet-to-be proven market potential...</p>

## Where was 5G at CES?

  <p id="5gXzaD">When it wasn’t being overshadowed by covid resurgences, CES, for the past few years, has partially functioned as a big 5G pep rally. But as cars, smart home standards, and <em>so</em> many screens took center stage at this year’s show, 5G took a back seat.</p>
<p id="XlfEUc">Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg gave a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band">very similar keynote speech</a> in 2019 and 2021, showing off all of the things 5G would supposedly enable: remote surgery, self-driving cars, augmented reality, and so on. T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert was slated to deliver the 2022 keynote before omicron put a stop to that. But in 2023, 5G was <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/5g-likely-to-be-low-key-affair-at-ces-2023/d/d-id/782370">hardly a footnote on the speaker roster</a>.</p>

The announcement is no longer live on the site (though <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-series-launch-date-leaked"><em>Android Central</em> points out</a> that the Wayback Machine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230107033326/https://samsung.com/co/unpacked/">managed to archive it</a>), but it was up long enough to give us an idea about when the next Unpacked event will be, and to show that Samsung is promising “epic moments.”</p>

A number of gamers use them as monitors since they deliver near-perfect picture quality at a similar price to high-end gaming monitors. It’s hard to blame them, but they’re putting up with lackluster stands, TV-focused interfaces, and having no DisplayPort, a staple for super-fast PC gaming. The pros might outweigh those cons for some, but it’d be great to get rid of most of those cons altogether. Thankfully, better alternatives now exist — a lot of them, actually.</p>
