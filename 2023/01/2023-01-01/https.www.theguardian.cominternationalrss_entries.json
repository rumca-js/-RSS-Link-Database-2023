It was at the catwalk shows last September that I first noticed. For the most part the clothes \u2013 which were for spring 2023 \u2013 were works of art. But a lot of them also looked deranged. Dresses full of holes at Chlo\u00e9, vivid crochet tops ripped at the seams at Marni, bras made from handbags at Givenchy and almost everywhere, trousers so wide they seemed to swallow up shoes.

The amount of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_underwear_index\">men\u2019s underwear sold</a> is not a perfect indicator of the direction of the economy. But as I watched one particular model wearing an unwalkably long, aubergine-coloured dress that pooled precariously around her heels, it honestly seemed to say \u2013 in a clipped French accent \u2013 that the economy, just like the model, wouldn\u2019t just topple over, but would also struggle to get back up again quickly. </p><p>Morwenna Ferrier is the Guardian\u2019s fashion and lifestyle editor</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/01/slobs-2023-fashion-portia-white-lotus-chaos\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/01/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2023", "title": "Fiction to look out for in 2023", "date_published": "2023-01-01 12:00:46+00:00", "description": "<p>With new work from Richard Ford, Lorrie Moore and Zadie Smith, plus second novels by Caleb Azumah Nelson and Guy Gunaratne, this is shaping up to be a memorable 12 months</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/01/nonfiction-to-look-out-for-in-2023\">Nonfiction to look out for in 2023</a></li></ul><p>During the lockdown years, I kept reading articles by novelists saying how unproductive they were feeling, how virus narratives had colonised their subconscious minds, destroying the creative impulse. 2023\u2019s novels \u2013 or at least those of them I\u2019ve read \u2013 suggest otherwise.

Purportedly a rediscovered ancient epic, it\u2019s about the transformative power of human creativity, the enduring ability of art to shape the world. <em>Birnam Wood</em> by Eleanor Catton (Granta, March) comes 10 years after the Booker-winning <em>The Luminaries</em> and is worth the long wait. Full of wit, big ideas and the most beautiful writing, it\u2019s the story of a group of guerrilla gardeners who clash with a billionaire prepper.

By then, he had been visiting Egypt, obsessively, for six years. His obsession began with a love affair. While working at a florist in Paris, Dailleux met a young Egyptian man, Sherif, and ended up following him back to his home country. Dailleux was intoxicated both by his romance with Sherif and the place and people he encountered. Sherif moved in a rarefied social world, but together he and Dailleux explored Cairo neighbourhood by neighbourhood, Dailleux taking portraits of the people they met, Sherif working as his assistant. Initially, Dailleux worked in austere black and white, but eventually, as he says in an introductory essay to a new book of his Egyptian pictures, \u201ccolour imposed itself\u201d.</p><p>Though his relationship with Sherif ended, Dailleux continued to live in Cairo, making different series of pictures over a period of 30 years: of veiled mothers and their bodybuilder sons; of the families of those young people who died as martyrs in the Arab spring uprising of 2011; of the evidence of political and environmental decline in the country in the last decade. All the time he was engaged in these projects, though, Dailleux returned to the culture of festivals and celebrations and cafe society that had first entranced him, the Cairo that still carried echoes of <em>A Thousand and One Nights</em>, but with an edge of modern reality. His aim, he suggests, was to get beyond the \u201cmyth of exoticism\u201d that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/12/roland-barthes-happy-100th-birthday-centenary-birth\">Roland Barthes</a> described in <em>Mythologies</em>, to be accepted as an insider.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://agencevu.com/en/book/misr/\">Misr </a></em><a href=\"https://agencevu.com/en/book/misr/\">by Denis Dailleux is published by Le bec en l\u2019air</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/01/the-big-picture-denis-dailleuxs-30-year-love-affair-with-cairo\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/01/ukraine-taiwan-north-korea-iran-palestine-flashpoints-2023", "title": "Ukraine is in the headlines now.

But a consideration of the hospitality business in 2022 has to begin by acknowledging that restaurants were trading into brutal, wing-stripping economic headwinds. As restaurants serve as a replacement for the domestic, it makes sense that everything that affects us at home also affects them. Energy and ingredient cost rises have simply been punishing. Restaurateurs have also had to deal with wage inflation. Even if they could pay those increased salaries, staff weren\u2019t always available for employment. The result has been a profound shortening of opening hours.

Given its prime location, it\u2019s still not appallingly expensive, but it\u2019s certainly not the great value it originally was. Many of you have been there and told me how great it is, so there\u2019s that, too. But it\u2019s tough out there.
