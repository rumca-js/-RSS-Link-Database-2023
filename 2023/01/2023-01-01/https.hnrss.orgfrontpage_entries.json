which counts Larry Brilliant, Ram Dass and Steve Jobs among its founders. The foundation's mission is to <i>\"build sustainable eye care systems worldwide by creating equitable access to eye care, building capacity of new and existing eye hospitals and systems, and collecting and learning from evidence.\"</i><p>I perused their website, and was taken aback by how common it is in many parts of the world for scores of people to suffer from vision impairment due to cataracts - a condition that can be easily cured with a simple surgery that costs 50$ to carry out.<p>It is a powerful reminder of the stark inequalities that exist in the world. I feel grateful that there are people like the Seva Foundation, who are doing something about it.<p>You can learn more about the foundation and donate to the cause at:<p>https://www.seva.org/<p>P.S. I am not affiliated with the Seva Foundation, I just found them to be a genuinely great organization and wanted to spread the word.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34208100\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34208100</a></p>\n<p>Points: 30</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/12/221205153722.htm", "title": "Blood test can detect 'toxic' protein years before Alzheimer's symptoms emerge", "date_published": "2023-01-01 16:54:57+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/12/221205153722.htm\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/12/221205153722.htm</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207996\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207996</a></p>\n<p>Points: 41</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://joemorrison.substack.com/p/how-internet-in-space-will-transform", "title": "\u201cInternet in Space\u201d Will Transform the Satellite Imagery Industry", "date_published": "2023-01-01 16:49:01+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://joemorrison.substack.com/p/how-internet-in-space-will-transform\">https://joemorrison.substack.com/p/how-internet-in-space-will-transform</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207926\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207926</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://til.simonwillison.net/clickhouse/github-explorer", "title": "Querying the GitHub archive with the ClickHouse playground", "date_published": "2023-01-01 16:45:56+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://til.simonwillison.net/clickhouse/github-explorer\">https://til.simonwillison.net/clickhouse/github-explorer</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207883\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207883</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207699", "title": "Ask HN: Is Programming Culture Immature?", "date_published": "2023-01-01 16:31:46+00:00", "description": "<p>I enjoy all facets of using computers, including programming, and am decent at it. I like many others also enjoy the theory crafting aspect which means spending time reading/thinking about programming and technical concepts and engaging with or observing discussions and even debates.<p>Programming is intellectually challenging, and that seems make insiders and outsiders assume that in order to have some success as a programmer, one must be intelligent, rationale, sensible, or heaven forbid, wise.<p>Yet in my experience, it doesn't take a lot a long time engaging with the digital-technical community at large to realize there is often a large gap between intelligence and wisdom or even basic sensibilities. A field which has so many tools to objectively quantify their work and the result so often are debates displaying poorly concealed biases and egos.<p>I was visiting the Star Citizen subreddit where a user posted a readable, short, simple proof of concept to improve a longstanding inelegant UI element.<p>I read debates about languages and see the most reasonable of authors walking on egg shells and writing caveats like they are commas lest one misstep allows a snowballing tirade of people missing the point.<p>And more universally, I see people who have acquired anywhere from basic to advanced competency spit jargon of the most specific like it is poetry, in a field where learning specifics on the job is the norm (and not that difficult), it seems people cannot resist using obtuse language to virtue signal their intelligence relative to other people.<p>There are obviously exemplary members of the outward facing tech community; they often have great success for being the foil to what is above, but more and more I become frustrated and begin to believe that progress in digital technology is greatly hindered by the low quality background of interaction between those who use it.<p>I say this fully embracing that in a domain like tech where extremely complex and nuanced problems need to be solved that disagreements, sometimes passionate ones, will need to be resolved one way or another - I am not against or complaining about that fact; I am simply growing tired of what I think most reasonable people can identify as basic immaturity and the surprising and disappointing commonplace nature of it.<p>Do I have to issue any more caveats? I am dead certain their have been numerous and highly successful workplaces which were the anti-thesis to these complaints.<p>I have less experience in this space and in life than many of you - so please offer your perspectives.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207699\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207699</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/why-a-global-recession-is-inevitable-in-2023", "title": "Why a global recession is inevitable in 2023", "date_published": "2023-01-01 16:27:24+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/why-a-global-recession-is-inevitable-in-2023\">https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/why-a-global-recession-is-inevitable-in-2023</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207654\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207654</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://avc.com/2023/01/what-will-happen-in-2023/", "title": "What Will Happen in 2023 by Fred Wilson", "date_published": "2023-01-01 16:23:06+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://avc.com/2023/01/what-will-happen-in-2023/\">https://avc.com/2023/01/what-will-happen-in-2023/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207614\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34207614</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-31/twitter-sued-for-nonpayment-of-rent-on-san-francisco-office", "title": "Twitter Sued for Nonpayment of Rent on San Francisco Office", "date_published": "2023-01-01 15:24:13+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-31/twitter-sued-for-nonpayment-of-rent-on-san-francisco-office\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-31/twitter-sued-for-nonpayment-of-rent-on-san-francisco-office</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34206993\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34206993</a></p>\n<p>Points: 78</p>\n<p># Comments: 65</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://milancurcic.com/2019/05/22/map-filter-reduce-in-fortran-2018.html", "title": "Map, Filter, Reduce in Fortran (2019)", "date_published": "2023-01-01 15:20:01+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://milancurcic.com/2019/05/22/map-filter-reduce-in-fortran-2018.html\">https://milancurcic.com/2019/05/22/map-filter-reduce-in-fortran-2018.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34206951\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34206951</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34206768", "title": "Ask HN: How do you manage your passwords in 2023?", "date_published": "2023-01-01 15:03:12+00:00", "description": "<p>I have yet to find a password management solution which is:<p>- secure<p>- easy to use<p>- accessible on multiple devices (home PC, work PC, and ideally phone)<p>I currently use a mixture of KeePassX (synced manually using SSH) and stored passwords (e.g., in my browser).
