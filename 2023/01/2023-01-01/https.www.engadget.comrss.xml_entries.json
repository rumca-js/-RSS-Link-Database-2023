The worst thing that could happen is that your to-do list or note-taking system ends up being so cumbersome that you avoid using it. Keeping all of your necessary tasks in your head may work on easy days, but it can quickly get overwhelming when you have a million things to handle in both your personal and professional life. I\u2019m a fan of <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RvZG9pc3QuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDI2OGNhYzAtN2VkYy0zZGI3LTk2NTItMGY1MDUzYjIxNGJhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdKleqkzJrybRhL9WYxG5Tywr6I5ERu_rJw8AXns6QzK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftodoist.com%2F\">Todoist</a> and <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a> (for iOS and macOS only) because both are detailed enough for big work projects, but simple enough for personal tasks. Both also have a Today view, which will show everything across all of your projects that need attention immediately.</p><p>While Todoist has a free tier, you\u2019ll pay $80 to get Things for iOS, iPadOS and macOS. <a href=\"https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/\">Microsoft\u2019s To Do</a> is an alternative that, while less involved than Things, is free and works on almost every platform including Windows, iOS and Android, among others. You can keep it simple and just have a task list and a grocery list, or you can go deeper and add due dates, sub-tasks and even share lists with family members. And if you don\u2019t want to bother with an extraneous app, you can always opt for the reminders app that (most likely) came preinstalled on your phone. That would be Reminders for iOS users and Google Keep for Android users.</p><p>Google Keep also doubles as a note-taking app, which will be a better solution if you\u2019ve been constantly jotting down ideas for new projects on Post-It notes or scraps of paper that you eventually lose. Apple Notes is the default option for this on iOS devices, and there are plenty of other note-taking apps out there as well.

You\u2019ll want to keep those recipes safe and readily available so you can refer to them when you need a quick weeknight meal or a dish to bring to your next family reunion. Recipe cards are a great way to do this, and you\u2019ll build up your rolodex of delicious meals over time. If you\u2019d rather have a cookbook of sorts that you fill in yourself over time, opt for a recipe book instead.</p><p>If you\u2019d rather keep your arsenal of recipes accessible at any time, anywhere from your phone, <a href=\"https://www.paprikaapp.com/\">Paprika\u2019s recipe management app</a> is the best solution I\u2019ve tried. The $5 app basically acts as your digital recipe box, allowing you to enter recipes of your own as well as download them from the internet. You know those hundreds of words that precede online recipes, in which the author divulges their entire life story before telling you their secret to making deliciously moist cornbread? Paprika strips all of those unnecessary bits out and only saves the ingredient list and the instructions. You can also make grocery lists and keep track of pantry staples in the app, so don\u2019t be surprised if it quickly becomes one of your most-used kitchen tools.</p><h2>Reading app</h2><figure><img alt=\"Scribd\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b7d91110-5db6-11ec-bef5-ab966a0e7fcb\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Scribd</div></figure><p>Don\u2019t take your habit of doom-scrolling into the new year. You could instead use the internet to find other things to read and the <a href=\"https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby\">free Libby app </a>is a good place to start. Powered by Overdrive, it connects you with your local library\u2019s digital collection, allowing you to borrow and download all kinds of e-books, audiobooks, magazines, graphic novels and more. Libby also has a tag system that you can use to \u201csave\u201d titles for later without actually putting a hold on them (although you can do that in the app, too). If you find a bunch of audiobooks you eventually want to get to, you can give them all a \u201cTBR\u201d tag so you can quickly find them and borrow one when you need new reading/listening material.</p><p>As someone who uses Libby on a regular basis, I love how easy it is to borrow from my local library without leaving my home. However, there have been numerous times in which my library doesn\u2019t have a title I\u2019m looking for. If that happens to you often, you may want to consider a subscription service like <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Ccm93c2UtS2luZGxlLVVubGltaXRlZC1Cb29rcy9iP2llPVVURjgmbm9kZT05MDY5OTM0MDExJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMjY4Y2FjMC03ZWRjLTNkYjctOTY1Mi0wZjUwNTNiMjE0YmEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVOmN1WcL8rlkAPnJhWnq3KWTM8WV7McsgUQINtsMRsQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBrowse-Kindle-Unlimited-Books%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D9069934011\">Kindle Unlimited</a> or <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JpYmQuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDI2OGNhYzAtN2VkYy0zZGI3LTk2NTItMGY1MDUzYjIxNGJhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASDpPoR0nUrxwYDfqQBjnIVi4FjqzkLmfmWR9UeY7oND&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2F\">Scribd</a>, both of which give you unlimited access to a wide library of e-books for $10 per month.

Sure, you could read on your smartphone or a tablet, but staring at those screens all day long can be tiring for your eyes. An e-reader like <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LaW5kbGUtUGFwZXJ3aGl0ZS1hZGp1c3RhYmxlLUFkLVN1cHBvcnRlZC9kcC9CMDhLVFo4MjQ5P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWUwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMjY4Y2FjMC03ZWRjLTNkYjctOTY1Mi0wZjUwNTNiMjE0YmEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAS_tPYM9EA02feQV4sg2JPcZ1Y2lW7psR23puceblZ0s&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported%2Fdp%2FB08KTZ8249\">Amazon\u2019s Kindle Paperwhite</a> or <a href=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-clara-2e\">Kobo\u2019s Clara 2E</a> is a better choice not only for its more comfortable display, but also because it focuses your attention on reading. (If you\u2019ve ever picked up your smartphone intending to finish a chapter only to be distracted by email or Twitter, you know how crucial this is.)</p><p>The latest Kindle Paperwhite has a 6.8-inch display with adjustable warm lights, 20 percent faster page turns and weeks of battery life. The Clara 2E is similar, with a 6-inch E-Ink display, adjustable brightness and color temperature, along with weeks of battery life. If you already get most of your e-books through Amazon, the Paperwhite is the best option. You can listen to Audible audiobooks, too, if you connect a pair of wireless earbuds to the e-reader. Kobo\u2019s device primarily gets books via the Kobo Store, but it also supports various file types like EPUB, PDF and MOBI. Plus, it has on-device integration with Overdrive, allowing you to borrow library books directly from the e-reader.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget"}}
