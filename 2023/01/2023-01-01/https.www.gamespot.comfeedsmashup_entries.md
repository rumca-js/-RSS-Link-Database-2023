<p>Home means a lot of things for different people. It can be a typical house with bedrooms and a kitchen or the memory of the moment Buzz Lightyear spreads his wings and proudly proclaims that he isn't flying, he's "falling with style." It meant something slightly different for Splashteam's Romain Claude and his 2019 Global Game Jam team.</p><p>"It's about gathering friends and bringing them to a safe place," he told GameSpot of his project's concept. "It's about going out and bringing them home."</p><p>The theme for the 2019 Global Game Jam was "what home means to you." That prompt turned into an early version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tinykin/">Tinykin</a>, where the player travels out into a dark forest in order to bring creatures to the safety of home. That concept, which was similar to The Wild at Heart or Pikmin, eventually evolved into the platforming adventure that explores an insect civilization living in a human-sized home that's stuck in the '90s.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tinykins-larger-than-life-alien-setting-brought-me-right-back-to-toy-story/1100-6510157/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4078100-january2023games.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>January used to be a slow month for new releases, but over the last couple of years, publishers and developers have taken advantage of this quiet gap in the gaming calendar to drop some pretty big games. This year is no different, and while the month ahead isn't crammed with new releases, it does have a fair number of high-profile games being dropped onto PC and console.</p><p>The biggest releases of the month are a triple-threat of genres and ideas that are coming for your spare time. Square Enix's Forspoken looks like a cool action-RPG where you utilize fast-paced magical powers; the Dead Space remake is a reminder to always cut off the limbs of Necromorphs; and Nintendo's Fire Emblem Engage is shaping up to be a leaner and meaner chapter in the long-running tactical-RPG franchise.</p><p>Anime fans also have plenty to look forward to, as a brand-new One Piece adventure and the release of two Persona ports will keep them occupied for dozens of hours. The Persona games being released, Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden, feature some great enhancements to bring it up to modern standards, while One Piece Odyssey looks like a vibrant RPG in which you can unleash rubbery blows, sword strikes, and flaming kicks.</p><p>For anyone looking for something silly to play or even share with their family, THQ Nordic's SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake could be just what you're after. It's goofy and colorful SpongeBob fun, plus with the original voice cast involved, it'll be an authentic trip back to Bikini Bottom. For the rest of the month, you can check out the list and highlights below to see what January has in store for you.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>One Piece Odyssey (January 13)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4078090-onepieceodyssey.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Set in the world of the mega-popular anime and manga series, One Piece Odyssey follows the Straw Hat Pirates on a new adventure.
