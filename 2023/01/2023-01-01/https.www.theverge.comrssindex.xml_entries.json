In <a href=\"https://telegram.org/blog/hidden-media-zero-storage-profile-pics\">an update on its blog</a>, Telegram says it\u2019s introducing a new blur tool that lets you block out certain areas of a photo or video, allowing you to hide sensitive information, or blur the faces of passersby who appear in the background.</p>\n<p id=\"IIS4pC\">To make the blurred portion of your photo blend in, Telegram says you can use the eyedropper tool to match the color of the blur brush to your image. Additionally, Telegram\u2019s adding a way to change the size, font, and background of text (sort of like Instagram or Snapchat) when adding it to photos or videos.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        \n      <cite>Image: Telegram</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>T...</em></figcaption></figure>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/1/23534248/telegram-revamped-media-editor-blur-tool-text\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/23527936/sony-alpha-a7rv-mirrorless-fullframe-camera-hands-on-ergonomics-pain", "title": "Sony\u2019s A7R V camera is a technical triumph, so why is using it such a pain?", "date_published": "2023-01-01 16:00:00+00:00", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"A front view of the Sony A7R V camera with lens attached, sitting on a patterned table with wooden model hands holding it.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j8iL72eEH8lUebziOH68hKLL_Mw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71812733/Sony_A7RV_camera_ADiBenedetto_0005.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption><em>Sony has pioneered many state of the art features in modern cameras, but it still feels like you\u2019re wielding something not quite meant for human hands.</em></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"FvVyQD\">There\u2019s only so much that really needs to be said about <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23424298/sony-alpha-a7rv-full-frame-camera-ai-video-price-specs-features\">Sony\u2019s A7R V</a> mirrorless camera. Sony made so many right decisions with this new model, that it\u2019s easily one of the best cameras money can buy right now. The new AI autofocus system is an excellent jump forward. The improved built-in image stabilization is excellent for hand-holding slower shots. The new articulating display is so good it should just be copied by all other manufacturers as soon as possible. And the 61-megapixel sensor yields some of the best image quality you can get today without jumping to medium format \u2014 trusting your computer and storage are up to the task of processing these beefy files. </p>\n<p id=\"oiIBqG\">But while Sony has made some recent strides to offer quality-of-life...</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23527936/sony-alpha-a7rv-mirrorless-fullframe-camera-hands-on-ergonomics-pain\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/23521184/kaleidoscope-review-netflix-series-giancarlo-esposito", "title": "Kaleidoscope is a generic heist story but a fascinating experiment", "date_published": "2023-01-01 14:00:00+00:00", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"A photo of Giancarlo Esposito and Tati Gabrielle in the Netflix series Kaleidoscope.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F14xPp_Y3dCC5wO7agQTJrNJCbY=/282x0:3318x2024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71812407/Kaleidoscope_S1_Yellow__00_42_00_04R.0.jpeg\" />\n        <figcaption><em>Giancarlo Esposito and Tati Gabrielle in </em>Kaleidoscope<em>.</em> | Image: Netflix</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"KSDfAq\">On the surface, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23507195/netflix-kaleidoscope-trailer-giancarlo-esposito\"><em>Kaleidoscope</em></a> is a straightforward, albeit generic, heist story. It hits all of the beats you\u2019d expect: the revenge-filled backstory, the complex process of finding a team and forming a plan, and the satisfaction of watching that plan unfold. And since <em>Kaleidoscope</em>\u2019s story spans around 25 years, you get plenty of all of those things over the course of its eight episodes. But that\u2019s not what makes the show interesting. <em>Kaleidoscope </em>is also a fascinating experiment, an attempt to tell the kind of drama most viewers are familiar with \u2014 but designed so that you can watch episodes in any order. As a nonlinear story, it\u2019s a success \u2014 but as a fun crime caper, <em>Kaleidoscope</em> leaves a lot to be desired.</p>\n<p id=\"4IIqwS\">The series is centered on Leo...</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23521184/kaleidoscope-review-netflix-series-giancarlo-esposito\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "title": "The Verge"}}
