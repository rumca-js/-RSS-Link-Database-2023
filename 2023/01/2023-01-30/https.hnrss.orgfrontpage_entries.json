Help?", "date_published": "2023-01-30 18:11:54+00:00", "description": "<p>Hi HN,<p>I'm the creator and solo developer behind Browserflow, a Chrome extension that lets you automate any website. (Show HN from around a year ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29254147). Basically, it's a general-purpose browser automation tool like Selenium/Puppeteer/Playwright that anyone can use without writing code.<p>The Browserflow website includes examples of automations people often request, including scraping popular websites like LinkedIn. A few days ago, I received a cease and desist letter from LinkedIn: https://browserflow.app/linkedin.pdf<p>As a one-man operation with modest resources, I'm hoping I can get some help from the HN community in understanding what this means to avoid getting sued into oblivion. :)<p>At first I thought that I'd be fine if I removed all references to LinkedIn from the Browserflow website, but I'm not so sure about that. One of LinkedIn's demands is to \u201cCease and desist developing, offering, or using software or programs with features developed, marketed, or intended for automating activity on LinkedIn\u2019s website or app, scraping LinkedIn member data, or otherwise violating the LinkedIn User Agreement\u201d.<p>Even if I removed all the LinkedIn examples, Browserflow could still be used to automate or scrape LinkedIn because, well, it's a browser automation tool. Is LinkedIn demanding that I stop developing Browserflow altogether?<p>The letter cites hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp as the legal precedent for why Browserflow is in violation, but there are some differences between hiQ and Browserflow that I thought might be meaningful:<p>1. Browserflow is not designed specifically for scraping LinkedIn: It's a tool for general-purpose browser automation, not a service that scrapes LinkedIn and resells the data.<p>2. Browserflow does not scrape LinkedIn on its own: Any automation of LinkedIn is initiated by the user using their own LinkedIn account.<p>2. Browserflow does not create or use fake LinkedIn accounts.<p>I'd be fine with removing all the LinkedIn examples from the website, but I'd like to continue building Browserflow because I love working on it and it's my livelihood. I'd appreciate any advice or help.

It helps consolidate installing and running different programming languages into a similar UX. It also is built with a plugin interface that makes it easy to build support for new languages.<p>However it is so slow. I was just testing `node -v` and it was taking ~900ms. That kind of overhead is completely unusable. My shell prompt uses runtimes inside of it for various things so this effectively makes every command take multiple seconds to complete.<p>So I rebuilt it in Rust but using the same plugin ecosystem so it should be a drop-in replacement. I also added a couple of features that I wanted from asdf (aliases and fuzzy-matching).<p>Let me know what you think! Just know that people have only been using this for a few days so if you see any bugs, they're likely not big hairy issues, just overlooked edge-cases and will be fixed

I have high problem solving competence in general, but most modern technology stacks people are regularly using seem to be past my time. I'm willing to put some work into correcting the difference, however due to the circumstances I'm in, it would really have to quickly and effectively pay off. It can't be a \"maybe useful\" kind of scenario.<p>I've come into a situation, largely due to how awful the rent situation is in the United States, where I pretty desperately need to maximize the amount I can earn under disability (which is around $1200 a month) without losing it.<p>I have 8-10 years of overall experience, and regularly program as a hobby, but I have not been employed for years.<p>The last job I worked I primarily wrote python scripts for automating things like data entry into a CMS and other basic front-end web development features using older technology.<p>What can I do to actually be able to get some side income in the software space here in 2023? I've talked with a couple companies in my situation and the answers usually are along the lines of \"well we can just hire a new graduate with up-to-date experience and they can work 40 hours a week for us no problem.\"<p>I'm in my early-to-mid 30s for reference. I'm not really able to get off disability as the condition is severe.<p>---<p>edit:\nI've already reduced expenses pretty much as much as I reasonably can do of course.<p>I've explored other options already as well. For things like Fiverr or being hired contract-wise on websites they seem to be races to the bottom so if I'm trying to earn $1200 a month I'm really having to work quite a lot harder and more hours than I'm really currently able to do.<p>I have some applications I've written that generated some interest, however if I want to make any decent money off them I would have to put an extraordinarily large amount of effort into marketing and post-release diligence which may well be past what I'm currently capable of doing.<p>I do tutor students as well intermittenly but it doesn't get me very much.<p>I've written some scripts and other little projects for people I know here and there for small amounts, but it is extremely inconsistent availability even though they trust what I deliver.<p>It seems like finding other leads in that regard is really my only option.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

and to also be a really great workbench for hacking/experimenting on different methods. Testing and getting a feel for how different methods work within this framework is truly a delight, and quite simple/fast. Additionally, generally speaking, many of the mathematical concepts should transfer, so this (for me) has been a really great proving grounds in testing out how something might work in a different place in the real world. We hope to get under 2 seconds of training time (for 94%) within about two years or so, so stay tuned for updates as we continue to push more changes that take us faster and faster than our starting point of ~18.1 seconds or so.<p>By the way, this architecture and training hyperparameters do indeed scale well, just increase epochs from 10->80 and base_depth from 64->128 and you'll have about 95.77% accuracy in about 188 seconds or so (just over 3 minutes :D). That alone is a huge boon! Great to see scaling laws working well within this very, very tight hyperparameter resolution.<p>Feel free to let me know if you have any questions, Hacker News always seems to get me the most traffic. I really love talking about this project, and can't really seem to find anyone to nerd out about it with. This is very, very cool stuff! So feel free to leave a comment, and I'd love to jump in and chat about it! :D :) <3 <3 :))))</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34574993\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34574993</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "http://www.mriedel.ece.umn.edu/wiki/images/7/7a/Riedel_Cyclic_Combinational_Circuits.pdf", "title": "Cyclic Combinational Circuits [pdf]", "date_published": "2023-01-30 01:23:53+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"http://www.mriedel.ece.umn.edu/wiki/images/7/7a/Riedel_Cyclic_Combinational_Circuits.pdf\">http://www.mriedel.ece.umn.edu/wiki/images/7/7a/Riedel_Cyclic_Combinational_Circuits.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34574771\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34574771</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/01/29/you-wish-youre-first-to-invent-this-scale-transform-50-xx-240-x-7/", "title": "Scale transform -50 x*x + 240 x \u2013 7", "date_published": "2023-01-30 00:58:11+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/01/29/you-wish-youre-first-to-invent-this-scale-transform-50-xx-240-x-7/\">https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/01/29/you-wish-youre-first-to-invent-this-scale-transform-50-xx-240-x-7/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34574570\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34574570</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Hacker News - frontpage"}}
