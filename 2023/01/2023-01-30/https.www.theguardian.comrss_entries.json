And for a certain kind of guitarist \u2013 like me \u2013 he was a fountainhead for an entirely new era to come.</p><p>I struggle to think of a player before Verlaine who synthesised the same range of influences \u2013 early Stones stomp and sneer, angular Ayler-isms, sensuous dreamscapes, extended improvisation, and spaghetti western twang \u2013 while dispensing entirely with the then-dominant white blues cliches. Sure, there were antecedents \u2013 John Cipollina, Roger McGuinn, and Jerry Garcia, for example, and I hear the wiggy high-wire tension of Mike Bloomfield\u2019s mid-60s work in there as much as anything. But Verlaine\u2019s sound with Television defined the archetype of the avant-rock guitarist, one that would become as much a template for the sound and feel of 80s guitar music as the contemporary innovations of Eno, George Clinton, Kraftwerk or Nile Rogers were in their own idioms.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/30/tom-verlaine-a-guitar-antihero-whose-sensibility-was-more-classical-than-clapton\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/30/many-ate-food-past-use-by-date-in-xmas-run-up-uk-survey-reveals", "title": "Many ate food past use-by date in Xmas run-up, UK survey reveals", "date_published": "2023-01-30 16:17:14+00:00", "description": "<p>Latest ONS data shows that people who ran out of food also struggled to keep warm as prices rose further</p><p>Many people in the UK ate food past its use-by date and struggled to keep warm in the run-up to Christmas as prices rose further, official data shows.</p><p>About one in five adults (18%) reported eating smaller portions and food past its use-by date, which can make people sick, according to the latest Office for National Statistics monthly data release on winter pressures.

In those first cartoons, she never even had a name. It was not until five-year-old Lisa Loring played the role in the 1964 series that Charles Addams christened the little girl Wednesday. Taking the name from the Monday\u2019s Child nursery rhyme, Loring became Gomez and Morticia\u2019s daughter who was \u201cfull of woe\u201d. The character, complete with her signature two long braids, black dress and crisp white collar, became an icon for goth girls everywhere. Loring\u2019s Wednesday always seemed wise beyond her years and cool in the face of all the spooky happenings in the Addams\u2019 mansion, creating the lovable morbid character who would capture the cultural imagination beyond any other family member. To this day, Wednesday Addams, and Loring\u2019s performance, is beloved by horror nerds, classic comedy fans and generations of women who grew up empowered by a character so unashamedly marching to the beat of her own drum.</p><p>The original show was shot in black and white and only ran for two seasons, but it came to be regarded as a classic TV sitcom that balanced zany slapstick with political satire. Creator David Levy kept the heart of the cartoon, with Wednesday and her family being spooky oddballs but ultimately a loving family. The show\u2019s 64 episodes aired on ABC in the US and ITV in the UK, but syndication means reruns are still being broadcast today. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/30/lisa-loring-wednesday-addams-goth-girls-icon\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2023/jan/30/man-pulled-from-stolen-police-car-in-us-moments-before-train-crashes-into-it-video", "title": "Man pulled from stolen police car in US moments before train crashes into it \u2013\u00a0video", "date_published": "2023-01-30 14:51:09+00:00", "description": "<p>Atlanta police rescued the driver of a stolen police car seconds before a train crashed into it as it lay overturned on train tracks.

Recently, a few weeks outside the warranty, it conked out. Fearing the worst, I phoned Reebok for technical assistance and was told that the problem would, most probably, be solved by a replacement console or a new mains adaptor. To my amazement, he offered to send both out to us free of charge, and they arrived a few days later. We are now up and running, (well, cycling), once again. <br /><em>NM, Oldham, Greater Manchester<br /></em></p><p>Twenty years ago I bought a bird feeder from Jacobi Jayne. It was guaranteed for life and I had already had the Perspex tube replaced once. Recently, a workman knocked the feeder off and broke the tube.

Despite the damage being accidental, I was offered a new model, which arrived free of charge two days later. <br /><em>IK, Newcastle<br /></em></p><p>My wife gave me a pair of Lamy pens in 2012. Ten years of daily use resulted in bits falling off the ballpoint, and the top no longer clipping on to the fountain pen. I contacted Lamy to ask where I could get them repaired in the UK.

To my surprise, it sent me a set of new locks with matching keys at no charge. <br /><em>NR, Newcastle<br /></em></p><p>I bought Smith Optics ski goggles from a shop in France.

Last month, the clasp loop was becoming frayed. The retailer wasn\u2019t interested, so I contacted Paul Smith to see if it thought the wear was normal. It replied that it looked correct given the amount of time I\u2019d owned it, but that as I\u2019d said I\u2019d only worn it occasionally, it wanted to resolve the issue. It was no longer on sale, but a replacement was found and sent for free.

Thereafter, the reader must carefully reassess everything they thought and felt about all that preceded it and only then will they understand just what a clever and uncompromising comic Paul B Rainey has created.</p><p>But what <em>does</em> the reader feel initially? For a long time, <em>Why Don\u2019t You Love Me?</em><em> </em>appears to be an unrelentingly grim account of the lives of a couple, Claire and Mark, whose relationship is in deep trouble. While Claire is depressed, drinks too much and spends her days in bed, Mark is in a state of permanent anxiety from the moment he wakes up on the couch downstairs. Newly returned to his job as a web manager following a period of sick leave (also for depression), he has no idea how anything in the office works. The pair have two children, Charley and Sally, but they\u2019re neglectful parents. The TV and the Xbox are their babysitters of choice; sometimes, they struggle even to remember the kids\u2019 names.

They like natural disasters; shark attacks; plane and shipwrecks; cases of mistaken identity; gruesome accidents; the paranormal; and stories with an element of revenge, enabling their favourite catchphrase: \u201cThat\u2019s what you get.\u201d This week, owing to a dearth of suitable material on my end and an appetite for injustice on theirs, I shared with them, hesitantly, the cold case of a woman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/30/chris-dawson-verdict-found-guilty-murder-former-wife-lynette-sydney-australia\">murdered by her husband</a> in 1982.</p><p>The disappearance of Lynette Dawson is the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/30/the-teachers-pet-hit-podcast-thrust-a-spotlight-on-lynette-dawsons-1982-disappearance\">The Teacher\u2019s Pet</a>, a podcast by the Australian journalist Hedley Thomas that has, to date, been downloaded more than 60m times. It is as brilliant and addictive as any TV show, with a list of witnesses \u2013 many of whom were never contacted by the police \u2013 so willing to share their memories of Lynette\u2019s husband\u2019s wrongdoing that it can make it hard to believe what you\u2019re hearing. It is also infuriating, revisiting as it does the case of a woman who disappeared from her home in Sydney in January 1982, leaving behind two children under the age of five and a husband who, two days after her disappearance, moved his 16-year-old lover into the house. Despite all the evidence of foul play, Chris Dawson, a former rugby league star and golden boy of the couple\u2019s upscale suburb, lived undisturbed for more than 30 years, while police accepted his story that his wife had run off. It strikes one with the dull familiarity of so many stories \u2013 the Yorkshire Ripper, most forcefully \u2013 of police failures around the murder of women.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/30/children-real-stories-not-fairytales-love-true-crime-childhood\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/30/the-wire-review-locals-deal-with-razor-sharp-border-fence-in-migrant-study", "title": "The Wire review \u2013 locals deal with razor-sharp border fence in migrant study", "date_published": "2023-01-30 07:00:11+00:00", "description": "<p>Documentary sheds light on responses to a fence designed to keep migrants of the EU Schengen area, a dizzyingly complex issue</p><p>Endless newsreel and column inches have been devoted to Europe\u2019s migrant crisis over the past decade, and we are no nearer to getting to grips with the problem. This documentary by Croatian director Tiha Gudac opens up a fresh perspective by focusing principally on the effects on destination or transit countries: namely a beautifully sylvan stretch of the Croat-Slovenian border demarcated by the Kupa River and, now, horrible lengths of coiled razor wire laid down by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">the EU</a> to prevent migrants from breaching the Schengen area.</p><p>The border fence sullies farmland and forests, complicates river tourism and separates Croatian and Slovenian communities who have ties going back centuries. The Balkan region is one with particular sensitivity to artificial segregation, and the local people tentatively fight back: early on, we see Croats and Slovenians joining up for a cross-border fun run. For those with long memories, this grim palisade, and the inhumane rejection of non-Europeans it implies, chimes with wartime fascism. But not everyone sees it that way: one father, mother and daughter spend their family time crawling under the wire to scope out points on the frontier where interlopers might be hiding.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/30/the-wire-review-locals-deal-with-razor-sharp-border-fence-in-migrant-study\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/30/should-i-buy-a-property-outright-or-take-on-a-mortgage-and-invest-my-money", "title": "Should I buy a property outright or take on a mortgage and invest my money?", "date_published": "2023-01-30 07:00:10+00:00", "description": "<p>My \u00a3200,000 offer has been accepted, I have \u00a3135,000 from sale of my flat and \u00a375,000 in savings</p><p><strong>Q</strong> I have had my offer of \u00a3200,000 accepted on a property.
