He always seems to flounder juuust a bit when interviews veer to this topic. I guess I'd get nervous too if I had proven ties to a millionaire pedophile notorious for controlling elites with sexual blackmail. Which is exactly why I make a point not to socialize with millionaire pedophiles notorious for controlling elites with sexual blackmail. That's on my \"deal-breakers\" list.</p><p>Today, Gates gave a very awkward interview with Australia\u2019s ABC 7.30. Not only did host Sarah Ferguson bring up Epstein, she even dragged Gates' ex-wife into it. This guy can't catch a break. </p><p>Ferguson asked, <em>\"One of the issues that's dogged you is that of your relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Do you regret the relationship that you maintained with him against Melinda's advice and wishes?\"</em> </p><p>Gates attempted to downplay his connections to Epstein, saying he \"shouldn't have had those dinners with him.\" </p><p>Then Ferguson went for the zinger, asking, <em>\"Epstein had a way of sexually compromising people, is that what Melinda was warning you about?\" </em></p><p><em></em>Gates denied this, claiming he \"had dinner with him and that's all.\" He also denied any relationship between his foundation and Jeffrey Epstein. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cBill Gates: \\u201cI had dinner with [Jeffrey Epstein] and that\\u2019s all\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201d</div> \u2014 The Post Millennial (@The Post Millennial)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1620078464878653441\">1675091780</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The creepy billionaire doth protest too much, methinks.

So, three years out, let's reflect on how this panned out for him. </p><p>For starters, law enforcement has <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-drug-cartel-crisis-fueling-national-fentanyl-epidemic\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> California is to blame for the country's <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-san-francisco-mayor\" target=\"_blank\">fentanyl</a> epidemic. Yes, you heard that correctly. California is responsible for the <em>entire nation's </em>crisis with fentanyl. With its lax drug, border, and immigration laws, plus the convenient plethora of highways that connect nearly the entire country, California is poisoning even the reddest of states with the fatal opioid. </p><p>In California itself, fentanyl overdose deaths <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/drug-overdose-deaths-in-california-are-skyrocketing-as-the-fentanyl-crisis-reaches-beyond-san-francisco/ar-AA12YmBD\" target=\"_blank\">spiked</a> 45% from 2020-2021. In L.A. County homeless shelters, deaths <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-04-22/la-county-homeless-deaths-surge-pandemic-overdoses\" target=\"_blank\">increased</a> by 56% from 2020-2021, primarily driven by overdoses. </p><p>In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-mental-breakdown\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco</a> <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/05/13/fact-check-san-francisco-project-room-key-provides-alcohol-tobacco/3111155001/\" target=\"_blank\">came</a> under fire for providing homeless people with drugs and alcohol while they were quarantined in hotels.

Second, please enjoy this video from 2008, when the then-Mayor of San Francisco Gavin Newsom promised to<em> end homelessness. </em>In San Francisco. In ten years. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cGavin Newsom vows to end homelessness in San Fransisco in 10 year...in 2008\\u201d</div> \u2014 Kevin Dalton (@Kevin Dalton)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheKevinDalton/status/1573016230792871936\">1663871269</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's important to keep an on eye California since Newsom is likely to be a top 2024 Democrat contender - given that Joe Biden can't speak and literally no one likes Kamala Harris.

It's a classic debate where two sides have polar opposite positions on a hot-button issue. Chloe Cole thinks genital mutilation in minors -- and not only encouraging minors to go through with it, but celebrating it -- is bad. Her opponents believe that genital mutilation in minors is the cat's pajamas and that all minors should do it in the name of \"inclusion\" and a few other buzzwords.</p><p>If Cole's opponents would use their words to lay out an intelligent argument, perhaps the two sides could find common ground. I can't imagine what the common ground would be, since Cole is the one who is on the right side of history.
