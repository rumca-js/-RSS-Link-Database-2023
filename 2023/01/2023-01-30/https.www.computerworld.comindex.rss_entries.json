Though large businesses tend to deploy a single image for all their workstations to lock things down (and limit customization), many small firms and home users want to make their desktop, well, <em>theirs</em>. Case in point: one of the first things I do after installing Windows 11 is move the bottom menu over to the left. After so many years of turning off my computer with the Start button on the left, I found myself always clicking on widgets to turn off my computer. Not only did that small change look better, it served as a small productivity boost.</p><p>The desire for customization is not new. As far back as I can remember with Windows, users have been installing <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-your-desktop-background-image-175618be-4cf1-c159-2785-ec2238b433a8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">custom backgrounds</a>, editing icons, <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-colors-in-windows-d26ef4d6-819a-581c-1581-493cfcc005fe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">trying out different colors</a>, and so on. But all that customization can come with side effects. Too often with Windows 11, a third-party customization tool will behave badly after a Windows update, prompting the user to blame Microsoft. But it\u2019s the tool that\u2019s acting up because it relies on registry entries that have changed.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3686614/desktop-tweaks-in-windows-can-be-fun-but-watch-out-for-risks.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3686512/apple-wants-to-build-a-new-computing-platform-with-ar.html#tk.rss_all", "title": "Apple wants to build a new computing platform with AR", "date_published": "2023-01-30 16:29:00+00:00", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>Apple\u2019s plan to create an App Store and an easy way to create <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3681892/apple-gives-up-on-reality-but-still-wants-to-extend-it.html\">mixed-reality apps</a> offers an<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-devising-software-to-help-anyone-build-ar-apps-to-drive-headset-sales\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> important insight</a> into its strategy and confirms that the company\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3684793/apple-wont-announce-vr-for-the-rest-of-us-at-wwdc.html\">sees these devices as platforms</a>, not peripherals.
