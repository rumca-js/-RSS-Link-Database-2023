<p>Power players open up about their fraught dealings with the Russian president, but the main takeaway is this: being a world leader seems like one long stream of mic-drop disses and gossip</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-has-invaded-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far">first anniversary</a> of Russia’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">invasion of Ukraine</a> looms. How did we get here? Well timed to answer that is Putin vs the West (BBC Two), a three-part documentary that will consider Russia’s involvement in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/07/ten-grim-lessons-the-world-has-learned-from-a-decade-of-war-in-syria">Syrian civil war</a>, before analysing the run-up to the sorry events of early 2022. Before all that, episode one takes us back to 2014, when Russian forces crept into and occupied the southern Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, to international outrage. Here is a tale of tense negotiations and uncertain diplomatic manoeuvres.</p><p>We begin in late 2013 – when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> pressed the Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, into pulling out of a trade deal with the EU – before revisiting the protests and politicking that brought down Yanukovych, as well as Putin’s military response to that slight. The roll call of contributors is impressive: prominent Russian and Ukrainian leaders appear alongside big beasts from the EU such as Jean-Claude Juncker and José Manuel Barroso. The impression we are given is that even at the highest international level – perhaps especially there – politics is an unpredictable, nebulous game of manners.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/30/putin-vs-the-west-review-like-a-gripping-terrifying-soap-opera">Continue reading...</a>

It’s also very important because I’ve seen previous coaches put on a mask or try and be something they’re not. The people you coach are too smart to be fooled that way.

<p>Rebellions and magical thinking have made the Conservatives look both arrogant and divided</p><p>Rishi Sunak is a Conservative prime minister who wants to be seen as a break with the past. The trouble is, he is leading a party that can’t escape it. The adage that “power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely” hangs like Banquo’s ghost over Mr Sunak’s agenda, disrupting his attempts to reset the narrative. The oxygen of Downing Street’s plan to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/30/rishi-sunak-set-to-unveil-emergency-care-plan-to-slash-nhs-waiting-times">save the NHS</a> was sucked out of the room on Monday morning as it sank in that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/30/nadhim-zahawi-pushback-helen-whately">Nadhim Zahawi </a>was the second cabinet minister Mr Sunak had lost in his first 100 days in office.

This has a ring of the 1990s about it. As then, scandals involving an exhausted Tory party hit the headlines. As then, an unpopular Tory government looks to have lost sense of what to do with power and lacks the initiative to push its own ideas.

MPs and peers assessed the bill and correctly decided that the ideal outcome for the country was to drop the deeply flawed legislation. It’s not a bill of rights so much as a bill of wrongs.

And how many other MPs and government ministers also avoid UK tax by this method of investment? The ministerial code needs to be updated to question if it is morally acceptable for ministers to legally avoid tax while they are responsible for raising taxes from the rest of us, who are not rich enough to use this loophole.<br /><strong>Rob Tidbury<br /></strong><em>Paulton, Somerset</em></p><p>• I suppose we should not be surprised that Nadhim Zahawi’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/29/in-full-the-letters-between-nadhim-zahawi-rishi-sunak-and-his-ethics-adviser">resignation letter</a> to the prime minister contains not a hint of apology, let alone any recognition that he had done something wrong. But then, in his letter to Zahawi, the prime minister could not bring himself to ascribe to Zahawi, in terms, the serious breach of the ministerial code unearthed by the ethics adviser.

She had not until then been involved in active politics but, with the African National Congress outlawed and thousands imprisoned in a state of emergency, she committed herself to the struggle. Ginwala, who has died aged 90 following a stroke, played a series of crucial roles in the achievement of black liberation.</p><p>She was not on the security police books so her anonymity was priceless. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/may/07/guardianobituaries.southafrica">Walter Sisulu</a>, one of the ANC big three, asked her to establish an underground escape route into neighbouring countries.

We step inside the revolutionary new London workplace that everyone wants to touch</p><p></p><p>There is very little about most new “sustainable” office buildings that is true to the label. Through an alchemical process of validation and certification, great carbon-hungry shafts of concrete, steel and glass are magically deemed to be “zero carbon”, and adorned with the gold and platinum medals of trade associations that exist to promote their members’ interests. The inclusion of solar panels, heat pumps, low-flush toilets and numerous other bolt-on gizmos creates an impenetrable veil of green goodness that can hide a multitude of carbon sins.</p><p>Just as covering concrete with plants does not make it green, filling a high-energy, high-rise glass office tower with low-energy gadgets does not make it carbon-neutral.

<p>The player who had been on the pitch for every league game since 2017 watched his team lose 1-0 to Iago Aspas and Celta</p><p>Weird things happened this weekend. The circle closed at the Bernabéu with a 0-0 draw that wasn’t just better than it sounds, but better than almost anything all season. Xavi Hernández, the Barcelona coach who declared “our history says you have to win and play well; a 1-0 in the 90th minute is no use”, went to Girona and oversaw a third 1-0 victory in a row, completing a run from pre-history to go five points clear and become winter champions. Real Madrid, who turned the plan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/28/its-the-start-of-a-new-era-ancelotti-plots-bright-future-for-real-madrid">upside down</a> by playing well and not winning, didn’t score for the first time in 30 games. And Real Valladolid <em>did</em> score, six matches and nine hours later and in the 90th minute, a Canadian flying to the rescue.</p><p>Cyle Larin’s coach had welcomed him <a href="https://twitter.com/realvalladolid/status/1617988651681714176?s=20&amp;t=HpOZoFDZ1LrpkucwGUMq5w">four days earlier</a> by admitting “we need your help” and he was just 14 minutes into his Valladolid career when he took off to volley a brilliant winner against Valencia. Cádiz, whose top scorer had two, the entire squad on eight, beat Mallorca 2-0, climbed out the relegation zone and then slipped in again, up five places and down four in a day. Sevilla striker Youssef En Nesyri, who hadn’t scored in 15 league games, scored twice in 15 minutes, the opener a leap so prodigious he could have cracked his head on the moon. And Saúl Ñíguez finished the way Atlético’s forwards don’t for his first in two years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/30/inaki-williams-la-liga-athletic-bilbao">Continue reading...</a>

(The primacy of hygiene in the profession seems to attract Conservatives to it; don’t ask me why – I don’t make the rules.) I could never signal how much I agreed with her because I always had a mouthful of equipment, so I would just make affirming noises, and this, it turns out, is the basis for a great one-sided friendship.

And for a certain kind of guitarist – like me – he was a fountainhead for an entirely new era to come.</p><p>I struggle to think of a player before Verlaine who synthesised the same range of influences – early Stones stomp and sneer, angular Ayler-isms, sensuous dreamscapes, extended improvisation, and spaghetti western twang – while dispensing entirely with the then-dominant white blues cliches. Sure, there were antecedents – John Cipollina, Roger McGuinn, and Jerry Garcia, for example, and I hear the wiggy high-wire tension of Mike Bloomfield’s mid-60s work in there as much as anything. But Verlaine’s sound with Television defined the archetype of the avant-rock guitarist, one that would become as much a template for the sound and feel of 80s guitar music as the contemporary innovations of Eno, George Clinton, Kraftwerk or Nile Rogers were in their own idioms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/30/tom-verlaine-a-guitar-antihero-whose-sensibility-was-more-classical-than-clapton">Continue reading...</a>

## Sunak’s job was to unclog Westminster’s fatberg of sleaze. His handling of Zahawi was entirely right | Simon Jenkins

<p>There is not a democracy in the world where Zahawi’s failings and Sunak’s response would have merited such a ballyhoo</p><p>Prime ministers do not need ethics advisers. They need theatre producers. The outgoing Conservative party chair, Nadhim Zahawi, was an able, popular politician and briefly successful minister. He did not break any law, filch PPE cash from the state, appoint a friend to public office, hug an aide or attend an illegal gathering. Like thousands of taxpayers he admits to making a “careless” error in his tax affairs. Like thousands, he found himself penalised. He failed to mention it when offered a ministerial job. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/30/nadhim-zahawi-pushback-helen-whately">He paid a high price</a>.</p><p>Cut to the prime minister. On Rishi Sunak’s arrival last year, Downing Street was compared to a sewer blocked by a fatberg of sleaze, corruption and incompetence. His job was to clean it. Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had emptied the cabinet of virtually all experience and ability. Former ministers littered the drains. An ex-prime minister faced an inquiry into lockdown law-breaking.

<p><strong>Symphony Hall, Birmingham</strong><br />Composers in their 20s and early 30s presented original miniatures in a diverse range of styles from English pastoral to jazz and folk to irresistible gospel and soul</p><p>Alongside the 20 large-scale scores that the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra commissioned to mark its 100th anniversary in 2020, it also asked another 20 composers, at the beginnings of their careers, to write miniatures lasting no more than four minutes. The original plan had been for all those premieres to be scattered through the orchestra’s season, but the disruption of the pandemic put paid to that idea. Instead, the pieces were brought together in Sounds New, a single concert conducted by <a href="https://www.clarkrundell.com/">Clark Rundell</a> showcasing the young talent in all its diversity before a hugely enthusiastic audience.</p><p>All of the composers commissioned were in their 20s or early 30s (the programme booklet was coy about dates of birth) and often differed widely in their experience and progress in their careers so far. For some of them, one suspected, this had been a first chance to compose for a full symphony orchestra, while others had already received prestigious commissions, and even had their works recorded. Rundell and the CBSO were marvellously even-handed in their enthusiasm for all the pieces too; all the performances seemed fabulously assured.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/30/cbso-sounds-new-review-young-composers-symphony-hall-birmingham">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I was in a Nike store in New York after Baz Luhrmann took it for Romeo + Juliet. The video came up on the big screen and the salespeople were all singing along. I had to go outside – I was freaked out’</p><p>In 1995 we had just released our second album, Life, and were touring a lot. We were in an airport somewhere waiting for a flight and were looking at material Peter Svensson, our guitarist and songwriter, had written for the next record. He played this song on guitar: it was a bossa nova at that point. I thought it was beautiful, but found the chorus “Love me, love me, say that you love me” too cliched, so I tried to offset its sweetness by adding: “Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.” It’s a song about how it’s very human to bend over backwards when it comes to getting love. The character is very calculating, aware that what they’re going to get isn’t real but that it’s better than nothing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/30/cardigans-lovefool-baz-luhrmann-romeo-juliet">Continue reading...</a>

In those first cartoons, she never even had a name. It was not until five-year-old Lisa Loring played the role in the 1964 series that Charles Addams christened the little girl Wednesday. Taking the name from the Monday’s Child nursery rhyme, Loring became Gomez and Morticia’s daughter who was “full of woe”. The character, complete with her signature two long braids, black dress and crisp white collar, became an icon for goth girls everywhere. Loring’s Wednesday always seemed wise beyond her years and cool in the face of all the spooky happenings in the Addams’ mansion, creating the lovable morbid character who would capture the cultural imagination beyond any other family member. To this day, Wednesday Addams, and Loring’s performance, is beloved by horror nerds, classic comedy fans and generations of women who grew up empowered by a character so unashamedly marching to the beat of her own drum.</p><p>The original show was shot in black and white and only ran for two seasons, but it came to be regarded as a classic TV sitcom that balanced zany slapstick with political satire. Creator David Levy kept the heart of the cartoon, with Wednesday and her family being spooky oddballs but ultimately a loving family. The show’s 64 episodes aired on ABC in the US and ITV in the UK, but syndication means reruns are still being broadcast today. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/30/lisa-loring-wednesday-addams-goth-girls-icon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Indie picture about a lottery winner who has squandered her winnings is catapulted into Oscar contention thanks to Riseborough’s remarkable, shapeshifting portrayal </p><p>To Leslie is a sad, sweet country song of a movie, with a steel-guitar twang of love and loss. Screenwriter Ryan Binaco was inspired by his own mother for this film, conjuring her memory in the spirit of Barbara Loden’s Wanda (1970) or maybe Scorsese’s Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (1974). Better Call Saul producer Michael Morris makes his feature directing debut. The film is ultimately just a little contrived and its final scene is not entirely plausible, but the drama is always fiercely watchable due to an undoubtedly marvellous performance from Andrea Riseborough – who last week put this little-seen indie picture back into the conversation and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/18/to-leslie-andrea-riseborough-oscar-campaign">made industry headlines</a> with her sensational outsider breakthrough into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/27/oscars-campaign-procedures-andrea-riseborough-backlash">Academy Awards best actress nomination list</a>.</p><p>Riseborough plays Leslie, a single mum who five years previously won nearly $200,000 on the Texas state lottery, a life-changing event for all the wrong reasons. Leslie squandered every dime on drink and drugs and now she is virtually homeless, a grotesque embarrassment to all the locals who celebrated with Leslie as she held the giant cheque up in front of her neighbourhood bar for the TV news cameras. She is estranged from her parents and her grownup son James (Owen Teague) – whose birthday provided the lucky numbers – and she is still entirely addicted with no intention of joining NA or AA, a subject which is never raised.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/30/to-leslie-review-andrea-riseborough-is-great-in-sad-country-song-of-a-movie">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Dyche wants ‘sweat on the shirt’ and to restore ‘good feeling’</li><li>Rennes winger Kamaldeen Sulemana among club’s targets</li></ul><p>Sean Dyche has been confirmed as Everton’s manager, taking over from Frank Lampard with the club joint-bottom of the Premier League. The team have lost 11 of their past 14 matches in all competitions and Dyche faces a daunting start with games at home to Arsenal next Saturday and then away to Liverpool.</p><p>Dyche was offered the job on a two-and-a-half-year contract after Everton failed to convince Marcelo Bielsa to take over mid-season. Bielsa said he would join now but would work behind the scenes until the end of the campaign, coaching the under-21s and younger players as the club adapted to his methods. That would have left Everton needing an interim manager and they were not willing to accept that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/30/sean-dyche-confirmed-as-everton-manager-on-contract-to-2025">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jennifer Lopez and the Duchess of Sussex are said to enjoy this ‘inner facial’. But what’s it like to have someone manipulate your cheek muscles from the inside? There’s only one way to know …</p><p>‘I’m always grateful that people put their trust in me to come and have such a weird treatment,” says <a href="http://www.lynnrae.co.uk/">Lynn Rae</a>, a remedial face and jaw therapist. The treatment in question? Intra-oral, or buccal, massage. This involves having someone massage your facial muscles – but from inside your mouth. All things considered, it <em>is</em> a bit weird.

<p>High-profile resignations highlight the nation’s struggle to prove to the world it is not, as Russia tries to suggest, a corrupt basket case</p><p>Since 2014, it has been a maxim that Ukraine is in fact fighting two enemies: Russia and corruption. The horrifically destructive Russian invasion is an existential threat to Ukrainian statehood, but corruption both undermines effective resistance in the war and derails Ukraine’s ambitions for closer ties with Europe. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/25/oleksandr-novikov-leading-ukraine-fightback-against-corruption">Eradicating corruption</a> is now literally a matter of life and death.</p><p>Eroding international trust in Ukraine’s government is one of Russia’s key objectives, in the hope that it could slow or reduce western material and political assistance.

Living in a post-apocalyptic graveyard, Ayham and Khalil now race against local scrap metal collectors to find what they can, which they are forced to sell at a reduced price. With what little money they make they buy food and cook together, dreaming of Aleppo before the civil war forced them to leave and waiting for an end to their bureaucratic limbo.

Tyre was a young, Black man who loved to skate board and take pictures. Memphis Police Department cops stopped him in a vehicle on January 7th. He ran – which is reasonable because cops routinely kill Black people and he wanted to live.

<p>Chris, 56, and Tom, 65, got talking at an Aids activism group in 1989 and finally kissed three years later. They married in 2008</p><p>The first thing Tom noticed about the man who is now his husband was his impressive presence in front of a crowd. They met at an event organised by a local Aids activism group in 1989, where Chris, now 56, was working as an outreach coordinator. “I owned a feminist bookshop in Fresno, California, where we were both living,” says Tom. “I was volunteering at the organisation and went to an orientation session. Chris was doing a presentation. I watched him putting a condom on a banana as part of safe sex awareness and that was it for me.”</p><p>They hit it off as friends, but when Tom asked Chris out he declined. “I was his supervisor and I’d made the decision not to date volunteers,” he says. Over the next few years, their friendship continued to grow through their activism, as they fought for LGBT rights and support for people with Aids. Through groups such as Act Up Fresno, which influenced public policy on HIV issues, and Queer Nation, which fought homophobia, they attended more than 30 direct action protests together. “I was once arrested in Sacramento in 1992, after the governor of California, Republican Pete Wilson, vetoed a LGBT rights legislation. Thousands went to protest,” says Tom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/30/how-we-met-i-watched-him-putting-a-condom-on-a-banana-and-that-was-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Anti-Slavery Society, founded 200 years ago this week, built a formidable political machine to end pro-slavery profiteering</p><p>Two hundred years ago tomorrow, a few dozen old friends and comrades gathered in a tavern on Poultry, the short street in central London. That tavern, the King’s Head, was known for its “unsophisticated wines and honest measures”. It acquired its name in 1660, when the restored Charles Stuart rode past and bowed to the tavern’s mistress. Who<strong> </strong>promptly fainted.</p><p>Now, there is no trace of the place at all. When I last looked for it, I found only the premises of a pharmacist, a tailor and a travel agency. Yet on 31 January 1823, a date for which there is no monument and not even a blue plaque, the King’s Head tavern played host to the inaugural meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/30/britain-abolition-slavery-society-200-years-radical-">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How the tomato sauce that defined a nation came to be, plus a variation on the theme that’s perfect for making in a big batch</p><p>While a pan burps and occasionally spits from the back of the stove, a story. The first description of tomato sauce arrived in Italy in 1628. It was from Mexico, of course, by way of Spain and the pen of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Hern%C3%A1ndez_de_Toledo#:~:text=Francisco%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Toledo%20(1514,by%20Hippocrates%2C%20Galen%20and%20Avicenna.">naturalist and physician to Philip II, Francisco Hernández</a>, whose detailed documentation of plants and Mexican food customs filled 16 volumes. Translated first into Latin, then Italian, one of the volumes includes a description of an <em>intinctus </em>(dip or sauce) “prepared from sliced tomatoes and chilli pepper, which enriches the flavour of almost all dishes, and reawakens the appetite”.</p><p>Not that anyone was eating tomatoes in Italy yet. They’d arrived several decades earlier, in the form of a few plants and seeds, again from Mexico, where they grew wild and were revered. In his recent and detailed <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/a-short-history-of-spaghetti-with-tomato-sauce-9781787703285">investigation into spaghetti with tomato sauce</a>, the Italian food historian Massimo Montanari notes that tomatoes were treated with both curiosity and deep suspicion; they could be eaten, but physicians of the time warned they might cause “torment to your eyes and head”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-tomato-sausage-ragu">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sam Riley and Haley Bennett are acrimonious exes staying at the same remote hotel in Jamie Adams’ directionless film that sees great talent go to waste</p><p>Prolific British film-maker Jamie Adams got me hooked with his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/31/black-mountain-poets-review-comedy">2015 comedy Black Mountain Poets</a>, a laid-back improv-realist caper with Alice Lowe and Dolly Wells – but then he sort of got me unhooked with his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/12/wild-honey-pie-review">Wild Honey Pie!</a> a few years later, a pretty indulgent and directionless film. And now I have to say I am defeated and disappointed by his latest flimsy creation, another let’s-make-up-the-film-right-here exercise which looks as if it was shot under lockdown/bubble conditions, arbitrarily, and frankly uninterestingly, marooned in a single location: a Cornish boutique hotel.</p><p>The air of sheepish pointlessness becomes pretty wearing after a while, despite the undoubted quality of his lead actors. As so often, Adams assembles a classy transatlantic cast: Sam Riley plays Idris, a former pop star whose career has stalled; he is now living with a younger partner, Louise (Marisa Abela) who appears to own or manage the hotel where they both live, but – rather bafflingly – Louise’s real vocation appears to be acting. She is fanatically running her lines for a tricky upcoming audition callback. So what’s with the hotel? Was she left it in someone’s will?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/30/she-is-love-review-romcom-sam-riley-haley-bennett-jamie-adams">Continue reading...</a>

## Young Fathers: ‘We’re not weird – this is the pop music we want to listen to’

<p>The Edinburgh trio are too rock for some radio stations and too hip-hop for others. But maybe it’s because their infectious, empathic sound shouldn’t really work that it definitely does</p><p>“Mistakes are good, and perfection is a sin,” says Graham “G” Hastings, explaining the creative ethos guiding Young Fathers. They have even coined a name for it: “mistakeology”. It’s the governing principle at their Edinburgh HQ, Out of the Blue Studios, an environment where, bandmate Kayus Bankole says, “You’re not afraid to make mistakes, to try”. Without it, the trio wouldn’t have happened on the chaotic, joyful brilliance of their sound, which has evolved yet again on their new album, Heavy Heavy.</p><p>This faith in mistakeology is partly atonement for the first half of Young Fathers’ career, the original sin that almost did them in. Meeting as teenagers at Lick Shot, an under-16s hip-hop night in Edinburgh, they bonded over their nascent love for the culture and were soon gathered around an old karaoke machine in Hastings’ bedroom cupboard, freestyling over beats. Drunk on MTV dreams of success and fame, at 15 they signed a “horrible, nasty production deal”. What followed was nearly a decade of sustained failure as their handlers attempted to shape them into “some strange fucking boyband”, filming videos nobody saw and recording five albums’ worth of music they hope no one will ever hear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/30/young-fathers-heavy-heavy-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## Rishi Sunak faces questions over Nadhim Zahawi sacking – UK politics live

<p>Sunak to hold Q&amp;A in north-east as Labour says ‘many questions unanswered’ over firing of Tory party chair</p><p>Yesterday <strong>Steve Brine,</strong> the Conservative chair of the Commons health committee, said the Nadhim Zahawi affair showed how the Tories were suffering from “long Boris” because this, and other, scandals originated in events that happened during Boris Johnson’s premiership. It is a terrific phrase, and a variation on the “long Johnson” version used by my colleague <strong>Rafael Behr</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/25/rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-prime-minister">in a column last week</a> (which itself may have been inspired by <strong>Robert Shrimsley’</strong>s “long populism” <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/82457bb1-9eac-46a5-a502-4c4eb79136b2">column in the Financial Times </a>earlier this month).</p><p><strong>George Osborne,</strong> the Tory former chancellor, made the same point on the Andrew Neil Show last night. He said:</p><p>The big question for the Rishi Sunak premiership was whether his high ratings could pull the Tory party up, or the Tory party’s low ratings would pull him down. </p><p>And at the moment he is being pulled down by a series of scandals which do not directly involve him, are hangovers, if you like, of the Johnson era. </p><p>I was the photocopy boy in Downing Street back in the ’90s when John Major had all these problems. And there are similarities in that John Major was likeable, conscientious, like Rishi Sunak, but ultimately, was not able to escape the downward pull of the Tory party. It’s still ‘we’ll see’ with Rishi Sunak, but he knows that as each week passes, as each new scandal unfolds, the window for action gets smaller and smaller.</p><p>To my mind, the defining thing of his political career was his decision to resign as chancellor from the Boris Johnson government over sleaze, over integrity, but he’s never really talked about that. </p><p>And we got the very first hint of it at prime minister’s questions this week where he started to say, ‘I resigned from the Johnson government’. I think you’re going to hear a lot more of that. I think he’ll have learned lessons even from the Zahawi affair, that you need to act more quickly than he did – and I think that he’s going to try and define himself now as ‘the sleaze buster’, but it’s extremely hard.</p><p>Sunak joined the health secretary, Steve Barclay, and the NHS chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, on a visit to the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton, Teesside.</p><p>They visited the hospital’s integrated coordination centre, a hub which manages patients coming in and out of the hospital and links up with community teams to help them be discharged, freeing beds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jan/30/rishi-sunak-questions-nadhim-zahawi-sacking-tax-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New research estimates that staff spend an average of one day a week dealing with problems.

It was beautifully made but, sadly, not right on me. I emailed the company to ask its advice. It sent me two more dresses in different sizes and lengths to see if they would be more suitable. It also offered to make a dress in a preferred length at no extra cost, and the owner telephoned me to check I was happy with their garments. The returns were free.

I contacted Jacobi Jayne to buy a replacement, but the feeder was no longer in production. Despite the damage being accidental, I was offered a new model, which arrived free of charge two days later. <br /><em>IK, Newcastle<br /></em></p><p>My wife gave me a pair of Lamy pens in 2012. Ten years of daily use resulted in bits falling off the ballpoint, and the top no longer clipping on to the fountain pen. I contacted Lamy to ask where I could get them repaired in the UK. Instead, I was asked to send the pens to Germany, and it replaced both without charge. <br /><em>DK, London<br /></em></p><p>I broke the lid on my 30-year-old orange Le Creuset casserole, which my late father had bought for me when I left home. Le Creuset said it would send an ex-display lid. Some time later, the company informed me that it could not find a lid in the correct colour, so it would send a new casserole, worth about £300.<br /><em>SM, London<br /></em></p><p>I contacted furniture maker Bevan Funnell for advice about a broken lock on a wardrobe which I had bought secondhand at auction. To my surprise, it sent me a set of new locks with matching keys at no charge. <br /><em>NR, Newcastle<br /></em></p><p>I bought Smith Optics ski goggles from a shop in France. A fastening broke recently, and I contacted Smith Optics hoping to buy a replacement strap. I had paid in cash and had no receipt. I couldn’t even remember the shop’s name. Nonetheless, I was told that the goggles were sold out, but that it would send a replacement pair when the new season stocks arrived. True to their word, they duly arrived. <br /><em>NM, Billinge, Lancashire<br /></em></p><p>Twice in the last year I’ve had to contact Shark UK about broken parts on my vacuum. Both times I’ve been sent a free replacement part with no quibble and free delivery. I think it’s great that some companies are willing to do their best for their customers. <br /><em>MC, London<br /></em></p><p>The stitching on the shoulder strap of my favourite Lowe Alpine rucksack came away, rendering a perfectly good sack unusable. I emailed Lowe Alpine and was given a job number for Rab’s repair centre. I sent it off, and it’s come back repaired, and was posted free of charge. That rucksack holds memories, as well as kit, and I’m so pleased. <br /><em>HP, Orkney<br /></em></p><p>I purchased a Paul Smith £85 leather bracelet in 2019. Last month, the clasp loop was becoming frayed. The retailer wasn’t interested, so I contacted Paul Smith to see if it thought the wear was normal. It replied that it looked correct given the amount of time I’d owned it, but that as I’d said I’d only worn it occasionally, it wanted to resolve the issue. It was no longer on sale, but a replacement was found and sent for free. That is what I call going the extra mile. <br /><em>KW</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/30/poor-customer-service-costs-uk-firms-billions-so-why-cant-they-get-it-right">Continue reading...</a>

## Sublime review – refreshingly understated queer coming-of-age tale

<p>Avoiding schmaltzy pitfalls, this moving drama about two friends nearing adulthood offers a modern ideal of masculinity</p><p>Unlike many queer coming-of-age films – which can lapse into sentimental self-flagellation – Argentinian director Mariano Biasin’s light-touch drama handles the thorny process of coming out in refreshing fashion. Friends since childhood, Manu (Martín Miller) and Felipe (Teo Inama Chiabrando) are inseparable during their teenage years. When not playing together in a band, the pair hang out at the beach or simply lounge about in their rooms, talking about everything and nothing.</p><p>Though each has a girlfriend, their attitudes to dating are completely different. While Felipe has a van fitted out just for the purpose of hanky-panky, Manu’s first sexual experience leaves him with more questions than answers. Awakened to his desire for Felipe, Manu slips in and out of sexy daydreams as the struggle to hide his true feelings grows increasingly difficult.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/30/sublime-review-refreshing-take-on-queer-coming-of-age-movie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this clever and savage tale about a horribly miserable couple – by a former winner of the Observer’s graphic short story prize – redemption comes with a sci-fi twist</p><p>Good as it is, I worry a little about this month’s graphic novel. Will readers stick with it long enough to reach the twist that makes the effort of reading its first half worthwhile? I can’t be sure that everyone will – and yet, I must not spoil this twist, even in the cause of encouragement. All I can tell you is that this is a book that requires investment; that eventually something unexpected happens, a left turn that takes the story slyly in the direction of science fiction and in doing so tips the whole thing clean upside-down. Thereafter, the reader must carefully reassess everything they thought and felt about all that preceded it and only then will they understand just what a clever and uncompromising comic Paul B Rainey has created.</p><p>But what <em>does</em> the reader feel initially? For a long time, <em>Why Don’t You Love Me?</em><em> </em>appears to be an unrelentingly grim account of the lives of a couple, Claire and Mark, whose relationship is in deep trouble. While Claire is depressed, drinks too much and spends her days in bed, Mark is in a state of permanent anxiety from the moment he wakes up on the couch downstairs. Newly returned to his job as a web manager following a period of sick leave (also for depression), he has no idea how anything in the office works. The pair have two children, Charley and Sally, but they’re neglectful parents. The TV and the Xbox are their babysitters of choice; sometimes, they struggle even to remember the kids’ names. Rainey uses an old-fashioned strip format, in black and white, as if his story had appeared first in a daily newspaper, the words “Why Don’t You Love Me?” appearing at the top of every one – and after a while, it’s a question the reader hardly struggles to answer. Whatever problems they might have, Claire and Mark are pretty horrible. What a pair of nihilists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/30/why-dont-you-love-me-by-paul-b-rainey-a-marriage-made-in-hell-veers-into-the-unknown">Continue reading...</a>

## A one-legged Patrick Mahomes ended the debate about the NFL’s best quarterback

<p>There has been some debate about the identity of the best quarterback in the NFL in recent weeks. Events on Sunday night put that question to bed</p><p>It was the most pivotal of moments. Tied game. Seventeen seconds left. The Kansas City Chiefs with a 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4 on the Cincinnati Bengals’ 47 in the AFC title game. In preordained fashion, it was Patrick Mahomes who willed his injured leg to join his healthy one and gain just enough yardage to eke out a first down. And then Mahomes was hit out of bounds by Bengals defensive end Joseph Ossai who, up until that gaffe, had played a tremendous game. The extra 15 yards given for the unnecessary roughness penalty was just enough for Harrison Butker to nail the 45-yard field goal and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/29/kansas-city-chiefs-cincinnati-bengals-afc-championship-game-nfl-football">send the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl</a> in four years and further cement Mahomes’s legend.</p><p>Had this been a regular-season game, Mahomes probably would have sat it out. Or maybe not. Maybe he really is superhuman, as we have suspected for much of his career. When an actual human suffers a <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22249-high-ankle-sprains">high ankle sprain</a> – as Mahomes did less than 10 days ago against Jacksonville – they are typically sidelined for at least three weeks. But Mahomes is a different breed: there wasn’t a scintilla of doubt he would play against the Bengals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/30/patrick-mahomes-kansas-city-chiefs-cincinnati-bengals-nfl-football-afc-title-game">Continue reading...</a>

<p>England’s long-time white-ball opener was hanging on to his place in the team before a spellbinding 113 in Bloemfontein</p><p>In the final Harry Potter book our eponymous hero was presented with a golden snitch – if you are unaware of what a snitch is, imagine a golden object of your choice – bequeathed to him by (spoiler alert) his recently deceased headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore. On it he discovered a riddle: “I open at the close.” For months he and his friends Ron and Hermione puzzled over the phrase, but to no avail: “No matter how often they repeated the words, with many different inflections, they were unable to wring any more meaning from them.”</p><p>These days any fan of English cricket would solve the puzzle in seconds: it’s obviously Jason Roy. England’s white-ball opener and one-time magician of the willow wand has been teetering towards the end of something for the best part of a year, a man on the verge of a statistical breakdown, a reputational abyss.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jan/30/jason-roy-rediscovers-magicians-touch-and-reverses-career-trajectory">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The gravel-throated legend gave his blessing to a show set to his greatest songs, but died before rehearsals began. As Dance Me hits the UK, its performers describe feeling his presence on stage</p><p>The voice is unmistakable. That rich grain and mournful, lived-in tone can only be Leonard Cohen. His song Suzanne plays, while on stage a woman falls into the arms of a man. He curls then lifts and balances her body again and again, without her feet ever touching the ground. The dancers are from Canadian company Ballets Jazz Montréal, and Cohen gave his blessing to the creation of this show set to his songs. He agreed to the music selections and chose specific recordings, but died in November 2016 at the age of 82, before the rehearsal process had begun.</p><p>“He was supposed to be at the premiere,” says dancer Andrew Mikhaiel. “He was supposed to see the show. So the moment we stepped into the studio on the first day, there was a weight to it. We had to represent him and deliver something quite magical. He’s a Canadian icon: it was such a huge responsibility. But at the premiere – I will never forget this – we were all in a circle together and we felt his presence.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/30/leonard-cohen-famous-blue-leotard-dance-ballets-jazz-montreal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was a good weekend for Amad Diallo and Son Heung-min – but a bad one for shocks and a rough one for referees</p><p>There was a grim moment towards the end at the Amex Stadium as Fabinho propelled his right foot through the back of Evan Ferguson’s leg, crunching his achilles. Ferguson stayed down in genuine pain, before eventually limping off. Fabinho knew instantly it was a horrible tackle and looked genuinely ashamed. Jordan Henderson knew it was a horrible tackle, apologising to the Brighton players and shaking his head. And yet the referee David Coote, somehow, didn’t. Neil Swarbrick, the VAR, also thought it was, you know, probably fine. Presumably this is an extension of the diktat about not re-reffing the game, allowing the initial view to stand if the on-field referee saw it clearly. But it is also the kind of mistake that discredits the entire fussicky, delay-ridden video system. Fabinho got a yellow that should have been a red, and a good red, the kind of red that discourages dangerous play. Don’t blame the robots. Humans are, as ever, the problem here. It is to be hoped Ferguson is not badly injured. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/29/brighton-liverpool-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Brighton 2-1 Liverpool</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/29/wrexham-sheffield-united-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Wrexham 3-3 Sheffield United</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/28/manchester-united-reading-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Manchester United 3-1 Reading</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/28/preston-tottenham-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Preston 0-3 Tottenham</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/30/fa-cup-fourth-round-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In gathering histories from one of the country’s darkest, most divisive periods, the former Guardian China correspondent has created a gripping and important document</p><p>In the 1990s, something odd happened in Beijing’s burgeoning fine dining scene. Among the chic eateries, restaurants emerged with very simple dishes: meat and vegetables cooked in plain style with few frills. The diners were not there just for the cuisine, but to relive the experience of a period generally considered a disaster: the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. The plain dishes were meant to invoke a time of restrained, austere living, when people thought of the collective rather than the individual. Only the sky-high prices reminded diners that they were living in a time of Chinese capitalism.</p><p>This recasting of the Cultural Revolution as a period deserving of nostalgia began in the 1990s, but it is still in full swing, and it shapes a struggle for ownership of history in today’s China. In <em>Red Memory</em>, Tania Branigan tells a dark, gripping tale of battles between Chinese whose views of the period – violent nightmare or socialist utopia? – still divide family and friends. Branigan was the <em>Guardian</em>’s China correspondent between 2008 and 2015, and during those years interviewed people whose lives were formed, for good or ill, by the Cultural Revolution. This book is not primarily about what happened, but the way that memories of that time shape, and distort, the very different China of today.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/30/red-memory-tania-branigan-review-cultural-revolution-up-close">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For decades Sylvie Boulay agonised about her weight, happy when it fell, miserable when it rose. After two brushes with death, she has finally found peace</p><p>Sylvie Boulay was in her 60s when she finally fell in love with her body. Growing up in Paris, she felt that her shape didn’t fit. At ballet class, the girls were slim and long-legged. From her mother, and society, she acquired “a very strong feeling that French women had to look a certain way”. It took a long time – decades, she says – “to realise there was nothing wrong with me”.</p><p>Boulay, who is now 71, packed her bags the day after she got her baccalaureate results and moved to London. She had visited England each summer to learn the language. By the time she was 18, she had friends there, and a boyfriend. Studying economics at UCL, she was free of the French dress code, but “in an environment with lots of young women who worried about their weight. I had friends who were dieting and friends who had eating disorders,” she says.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/04/tell-us-has-your-life-taken-a-new-direction-after-the-age-of-65">Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/30/a-new-start-after-60-i-survived-cancer-and-learned-to-respect-my-amazing-body">Continue reading...</a>

## I tell my children real stories, not fairytales. Should I worry about their love of true crime? | Emma Brockes

<p>They listen to adult stories and ask mature questions. I just hope it doesn’t rob them of a playful aspect of childhood</p><p>On the walk to school every morning my children ask for a story, and their tastes – formed by my own – skew towards real-life drama. They like natural disasters; shark attacks; plane and shipwrecks; cases of mistaken identity; gruesome accidents; the paranormal; and stories with an element of revenge, enabling their favourite catchphrase: “That’s what you get.” This week, owing to a dearth of suitable material on my end and an appetite for injustice on theirs, I shared with them, hesitantly, the cold case of a woman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/30/chris-dawson-verdict-found-guilty-murder-former-wife-lynette-sydney-australia">murdered by her husband</a> in 1982.</p><p>The disappearance of Lynette Dawson is the subject of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/30/the-teachers-pet-hit-podcast-thrust-a-spotlight-on-lynette-dawsons-1982-disappearance">The Teacher’s Pet</a>, a podcast by the Australian journalist Hedley Thomas that has, to date, been downloaded more than 60m times. It is as brilliant and addictive as any TV show, with a list of witnesses – many of whom were never contacted by the police – so willing to share their memories of Lynette’s husband’s wrongdoing that it can make it hard to believe what you’re hearing. It is also infuriating, revisiting as it does the case of a woman who disappeared from her home in Sydney in January 1982, leaving behind two children under the age of five and a husband who, two days after her disappearance, moved his 16-year-old lover into the house. Despite all the evidence of foul play, Chris Dawson, a former rugby league star and golden boy of the couple’s upscale suburb, lived undisturbed for more than 30 years, while police accepted his story that his wife had run off. It strikes one with the dull familiarity of so many stories – the Yorkshire Ripper, most forcefully – of police failures around the murder of women.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/30/children-real-stories-not-fairytales-love-true-crime-childhood">Continue reading...</a>

## The Wire review – locals deal with razor-sharp border fence in migrant study

<p>Documentary sheds light on responses to a fence designed to keep migrants of the EU Schengen area, a dizzyingly complex issue</p><p>Endless newsreel and column inches have been devoted to Europe’s migrant crisis over the past decade, and we are no nearer to getting to grips with the problem. This documentary by Croatian director Tiha Gudac opens up a fresh perspective by focusing principally on the effects on destination or transit countries: namely a beautifully sylvan stretch of the Croat-Slovenian border demarcated by the Kupa River and, now, horrible lengths of coiled razor wire laid down by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu">the EU</a> to prevent migrants from breaching the Schengen area.</p><p>The border fence sullies farmland and forests, complicates river tourism and separates Croatian and Slovenian communities who have ties going back centuries. The Balkan region is one with particular sensitivity to artificial segregation, and the local people tentatively fight back: early on, we see Croats and Slovenians joining up for a cross-border fun run. For those with long memories, this grim palisade, and the inhumane rejection of non-Europeans it implies, chimes with wartime fascism. But not everyone sees it that way: one father, mother and daughter spend their family time crawling under the wire to scope out points on the frontier where interlopers might be hiding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/30/the-wire-review-locals-deal-with-razor-sharp-border-fence-in-migrant-study">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She has notched up too many firsts to count. As the work that triumphed so spectacularly in Venice returns to Britain, the once-uncollectable artist explains<strong> </strong>why she now even has a 10-year vision</p><p>When Sonia Boyce was at primary school she won a book. “It was the first one that actually belonged to me, rather than just being in the house or from the school library,” she says. The book was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and she was particularly fascinated by Willy Wonka’s lickable, snozzberry-covered wallpaper, and the square sweets that looked round. It was a lightbulb moment, involving “this conundrum, a perceptual thing that I couldn’t figure out”.</p><p>As a young child she had found wallpaper terrifying, she explains. “It definitely fed into my nightmares. I’d wake up convinced that the wallpaper was moving and I actually do believe that there is something about it that is like entering a storybook or a fable, even though it’s this thing that’s meant to sit in the background, quietly, holding a space.” Her parental home in London was papered in the jazzy designs that were popular in the 60s and 70s; her current home has nothing except bookshelves on the walls – not even pictures, she says.

<p>Shaken by the death of her sitcom co-star Robin Williams, the actor put her career on hold for the best part of a decade. Now she’s back battling supernatural beings in Wolf Pack – but will she ever revive the Slayer?</p><p>When Sarah Michelle Gellar was sent the script for a new supernatural teen drama, her first instinct was to let the dead lie. “I was like, ‘I’m not reading it,’” she says firmly. “Werewolves? No, thank you – been there, done that.”</p><p>After all, 20 years after Gellar laid down her stakes and scythe, audiences are still obsessing over Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The TV show, which ran for seven seasons from 1997 to 2003, inspired <a href="https://www.npr.org/2003/05/13/1262180/buffy-studies">an academic discipline</a>, with journals, conferences and scholars known as “Buffyologists”.

## England’s old boys’ club has evolved into ‘the network’, made up of high rollers and city slicks | Nesrine Malik

<p>Scandals involving such senior MPs as Zahawi highlight the shift in powerbrokering from landed gentry to financiers and businessmen</p><p>The old boys’ club. We don’t hear about it as much as we used to, do we? The phrase seems a little dusty, a bit of a throwback. Harrovians, Etonians, Wykehamists and other privately educated politicians may constitute 80% of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom_by_education">Britain’s prime ministers so far</a>; but they increasingly sit cheek by jowl in parliament with others who did not go to fee-paying schools, are not male, not white – and not only did not go to Oxbridge, but are not university educated at all.</p><p>And yet here we are, riffling through the seedy dealings of a small connected group of people at the top. The past few weeks of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/22/tories-policy-conservative-party-government">Conservative scandals</a> are proof that this network is still alive and well. What these scandals also reveal is an evolution in the network’s character – high finance and mercantilism are becoming a fast track for new members into this particular political elite’s ranks.</p><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/30/england-old-boys-club-zahawi-wealthy-network">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When one of the Serb’s strengths failed in Melbourne he still had so much more in his game than any of his opponents</p><p>As Tommy Paul looked back on the brutal experience of facing Novak Djokovic for the first time in his career on Rod Laver Arena last week, he sighed deeply. Paul had entered his first grand slam semi-final with a wealth of different ideas about how he would disrupt his opponent and impose himself. He soon found that they amounted to nothing.</p><p>Paul had wanted to serve and volley, he explained, but Djokovic’s returns peppered the baseline and instead forced him back. He wanted to mix drop shots into his game, but Djokovic’s incessant depth made it impossible. He had planned to slice but he was already under immense pressure on his backhand wing from early on. “He didn’t really let me execute any of the game plan that I had laid out for myself,” he said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/30/australian-open-win-serves-a-reminder-of-novak-djokovics-foolproof-game">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russian shelling of Kherson kills three; Erdoğan signals Turkey may agree to Finland joining Nato without Sweden</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Russian shelling of residential areas in Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson left at least three people dead and five injured,</strong> <strong>local authorities said.</strong> The Kherson regional military administration said on its Telegram channel that Russian forces targeted a hospital, school, bus station, post office, bank and residential buildings in a strike on Sunday.</p><p><strong>A missile hit an apartment building in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, killing one person and injuring others, according to the regional governor.</strong> Oleh Synehubov said the missile struck the city centre on Sunday.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s military and Russia’s Wagner private military group are both claiming to have control in the area of Blahodatne, eastern Donetsk region. </strong>“Units of Ukraine’s defence forces repelled the attacks of the occupiers in the areas of … Blahodatne … in the Donetsk region,” Ukraine’s military reported, adding its forces also repelled attacks in 13 other settlements in the Donetsk region. Wagner, designated by the US as transnational criminal organisation, said on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday that its units had taken control of Blahodatne.</p><p><strong>President Tayyip Erdoğan signalled that Turkey may agree to Finland joining Nato without Sweden</strong>, amid growing tensions with Stockholm. “We may deliver Finland a different message [on their Nato application] and Sweden would be shocked when they see our message. But Finland should not make the same mistake Sweden did,” Erdoğan said in a televised speech aired on Sunday. Sweden and Finland applied last year to join Nato and need all member countries’ approval to join. Turkey and Hungary are holding out.</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin was open to contacts with Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz,</strong> <strong>though no phone call was scheduled</strong>, a Kremlin spokesperson told the state Ria Novosti news agency. Scholz told the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel: “I will also speak to Putin again – because it is necessary to speak.”</p><p><strong>Kyiv and its western allies are engaged in “fast-track” talks on the possibility of equipping Ukraine with long-range missiles and military aircraft</strong>, a top aide to Ukraine’s president said. Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine’s supporters in the west “understand how the war is developing” and the need to supply planes capable of providing cover for armoured vehicles the US and Germany have pledged.</p><p><strong>US military officials are reportedly urging the Pentagon to supply F-16 jets to Ukraine</strong> so it is better able to defend itself from Russian missiles and drones.</p><p><strong>Olaf Scholz reiterated on Sunday that Germany will not send fighter jets. </strong>“I can only advise against entering into a constant bidding war when it comes to weapons systems,” Scholz said in an interview with the Tagesspiegel newspaper. “If, as soon as a decision [on tanks] has been made, the next debate starts in Germany, that doesn’t come across as serious and undermines citizens’ confidence in government decisions.”</p><p><strong>Russia’s ministry of education has provided further details on plans to include basic military training in secondary schools, according to Britsh intelligence.</strong> The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on Sunday that the module “will include training with AK series assault rifles and hand grenades, military drill and salutes”. It added that the initiatives, to come into force in September, were most likely a deliberate “evocation of the Soviet Union” as similar training took place in schools up until 1993.</p><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up his campaign to keep Russian athletes out of the 2024 Paris Games</strong>. Ukraine’s president said he had sent a letter to Emmanuel Macron, and allowing Russia to compete would be tantamount to showing that “terror is somehow acceptable”.</p><p><strong>Ukraine has imposed sanctions against 182 Russian and Belarusian companies, and three individuals</strong>, in the latest of a series of steps to block Moscow’s and Minsk’s connections to Ukraine. The sanctioned companies chiefly engage in the transportation of goods, vehicle leasing and chemical production, according to the list published by Ukraine’s national security and defence council.</p><p><strong>Mourners gathered in Kyiv on Sunday to commemorate a British volunteer killed while on a rescue mission from the eastern Ukrainian town of Soledar.</strong> British voluntary aid worker Andrew Bagshaw and fellow volunteer Chris Parry were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/24/two-missing-britons-killed-in-ukraine-family-say">killed during an attempted humanitarian evacuation</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-341-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
