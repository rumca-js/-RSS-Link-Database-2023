Regularly priced at $130, this is a nice little discount for those who are looking for a new Xbox controller. All customers get free shipping, but, naturally, Prime members will get the controller sooner. The Elite Series 2 Core controller released last fall as a budget alternative to the standard Elite Series 2. However, the Core version does not come with any of the attachments, though they can be purchased separately.</p><p>This means you won't get back paddles, four extra analog sticks to swap, a swappable D-pad, or the carrying case. Instead, the Core controller simply features the premium build of the Elite Series 2 controller--nicer sticks, trigger locks, an eight-way metal D-pad, and tactile handle grips.</p><p>If you decide you want the back paddles and other accessories, you can always purchase them separately.

## Netflix Drops Live-Action One Piece Posters, Announces Release Window

<p dir="ltr">Netflix has shown off the first images of its live-action One Piece, and its sights are certainly familiar for anime fans. Based on the ultra-popular (and famously long-running) manga of the same name, One Piece will be a pirate adventure starring Iñaki Godoy as Monkey D. Luffy, an adventurer who seeks the titular treasure to make his name and achieve immortality as the next pirate king. It's also coming in 2023, which is big news.</p><figure style="width: 1500px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4093183-en-us_onepiece_teaser_luffy_vertical_27x40_rgb_pre.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1596/15969599/4093183-en-us_onepiece_teaser_luffy_vertical_27x40_rgb_pre.jpg" /></a></figure><figure style="width: 450px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4093192-onepiece2.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4093192-onepiece2.jpg" /></a></figure><p dir="ltr">The poster itself features Godoy wearing the series' well-known straw hat, as well as the red vest closely associated with the Luffy character. The art also includes the silhouettes of several other "Straw Hats"--associates of Luffy--including fan favorites like Sanji, Usopp, Nami, and Roronoa Zoro.</p><p dir="ltr">Steven Maeda is the writer, showrunner, and executive producer of the show, best-known for their work on Lost and The X-Files. Writer and executive producer Matt Owens worked on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Luke Cage. The original creator of the manga, Eiichiro Oda, is also an executive producer on the project.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-drops-live-action-one-piece-posters-announces-release-window/1100-6510995/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Ahead of the game's full reveal, the cover star for MLB The Show 23 has been announced, and it's 24-year-old Jazz Chisholm of the Miami Marlins. As many have observed following the announcement, Chisholm was an unexpected choice.</p><p>He is an exciting upcoming player but doesn't have the star power of, say, Shohei Ohtani, who was MLB The Show 22's cover star. In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/01/30/the-electric-jazz-chisholm-jr-is-your-mlb-the-show-23-cover-athlete/">PlayStation Blog post</a>, San Diego Studio's Ramone Russell said, "Jazz Chisholm Jr.'s electric personality, play, and love for all things baseball made him a great choice to be on the cover of MLB The Show 23."</p><div>          </div><p>MLB The Show 23 launches on March 28, which is two days before the new MLB season begins on March 30. The game will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch. The game will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass. Preorders begin February 6.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-23-coming-to-game-pass-day-one-jazz-chisholm-revealed-as-cover-star/1100-6510994/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Sunday night's new episode of The Last of Us was memorable for a number of reasons, one of which was its use of the Linda Ronstadt song "Long Long Time," which was also the name of the episode. The song, which was originally released in 1970, saw a massive uptick in Spotify streams on Sunday night.</p><p>According to Spotify, the song saw a more than 4,900% increase in streams in the US on January 29 between 11 PM and midnight ET, following the episode's airing. The increase is compared to the week prior. Spotify did not, however, announce exactly how many streams the song had last week or this week during the growth period. In any event, clearly people watched The Last of Us and then listened to the song, not unlike how Kate Bush's "Running Up That Hill" saw an explosion in popularity after being featured in the newest season of Stranger Things. </p><p><strong>Spoilers for The Last of Us episode three follow below.</strong></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-episode-3-helps-song-from-1970-explode-4900-in-spotify-streams/1100-6510989/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Marvel Snap's PvP Battle Mode Coming Tuesday

<p>You'll finally be able to throw down against your friends in Marvel Snap very soon. Developer Second Dinner announced that the new feature, called Battle Mode, is coming Tuesday, January 31. A teaser image accompanying the announcement shows Squirrel Girl facing off against Arnim Zola, both of which are popular cards in the meta.</p><p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/MARVELSNAP/status/1620130774925312001">previously detailed</a>, Battle Mode will let you play against your friends (or frenemies) by sharing a code to start matches. Each player starts with 10 bars of health, and snapping will do double damage. Since launch, Marvel Snap has only supported PvP against random opponents on a ranked ladder.</p><p>Second Dinner also mentioned previously that Battle Mode would come alongside Series Drop. That system will drop select cards from Series 5 to Series 4, and some from Series 4 to Series 3. That will make them easier to obtain as time goes on. Second Dinner is also planning to add new "First Edition" badges, which will mark cards with a small label if you obtained them before they dropped in series rank. The studio doesn't have a timeline yet for this feature, but it says it intends to apply the labels to your collection retroactively, so you'll retain your bragging rights.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snaps-pvp-battle-mode-coming-tuesday/1100-6510992/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>During the 30th anniversary NIS stream, the company announced two new titles. First, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless, which adds samurai and catgirls with laser guns to its hellish SRPG formula. Second, Rhapsody: Marl Kingdom Chronicles, which brings two classic JRPGs to North America and Europe for the first time.</p><p>Disgaea 7 is set in the netherworld Hinomoto, inspired by historical Japan. The game follows the demon warrior Fuji and his companion Pirilika, a catgirl with a gun. Among the more than 40 character classes are also a boxing witch and a gun-touting samurai.</p><div>          </div><p>It introduces a variety of new mechanics like Jumbability, which increases characters to a massive size so they can deal massive damage. Item reincarnation lets players level up their items by turning them into something else. A favorite axe could become a stack of pancakes, for example. Players can also test their skills against AI or other players in online multiplayer. The strategy RPG is set to release during Summer 2023 in Europe, and Fall 2023 in North America. It will be available on PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disgaea-7-vows-of-the-virtueless-brings-catgirls-and-samurai-to-the-storied-srpg-franchise/1100-6510990/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Revisiting GoldenEye 007 25 Years Later

<p dir="ltr">Not long after celebrating its 25th anniversary last year, the tangled nest of rights issues surrounding GoldenEye 007 was untangled just enough for the classic first-person shooter to be ported to modern platforms. Xbox Game Pass and Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, as well as digital owners of Rare Replay, now have access to Rare's seminal FPS.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, your platform of choice may have a significant impact on the experience, with the Switch version being the only one to support online multiplayer (but being saddled with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/goldeneye-007-controls-on-switch-are-wildly-unintuitive/1100-6510933/">less-than-ideal controls</a>, to say the least). Some complaints have emerged regarding various technical issues, the Xbox version's developer, Code Mystics, has provided explanations where it can, such as how 60fps support (which was now included) created issues and how visual glitches are authentic to the original version on Nintendo 64.</p><p dir="ltr">However you feel about that, there's no denying GoldenEye was a critical game in the history of first-person shooters, particularly on console. But what's it like to play now? Rose-colored glasses can make an old game seem better in our memories than it would be to actually play, so we put the game through its paces to see what we make of the game in 2023.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/revisiting-goldeneye-007-25-years-later/1100-6510988/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft: Dragonflight's</a> worst DPS specializations, Retribution Paladin, will see a significant talent tree rework in the game's upcoming patch 10.0.7, Blizzard has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">In a lengthy <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/retribution-paladin-design-in-1007/1502892">forum post</a>, Blizzard explained all the reasons it is currently unhappy with the state of the specialization: button bloat, too many stacking modifiers, a lack of survivability, poor maneuverability, and missing group utility.</p><p dir="ltr">"Retribution Paladins currently have one of the highest death rates across all forms of content," Blizzard said. "For a plate wearing class with hybrid healing, this doesn't feel right. We're looking to strengthen them through a mixture of passive bonus and improvements to active abilities and cooldowns, while keeping the degree of challenge that results from being a melee-based spec."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-will-rework-one-of-wow-dragonflight-worst-dps-specializations/1100-6510987/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Dead Space Remake Should Look Better In The Dark After Upcoming Update

<p>A fix for Dead Space's VRS issues is coming, though no exact release window for the patch has been shared yet. The game's implementation of VRS can cause a surprising lack of detail in some textures.</p><p>VRS, variable rate shading, is a process which allocates <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/variable-rate-shading-vrs-definition-nvidia-graphics,6342.html">a graphic card's processing across multiple parts of an image</a>. This allows the GPU to use more processing power on complex parts of a render and less on simpler parts. The Dead Space remake usage of VRS has caused some visual issues. Objects or textures that appear in shadow have notably less visual detail than lighted models or other objects in the foreground. In theory, this is fine, but for a horror game that takes place largely in the dark, it can be distracting.</p><p>The issue even appears on PC, and there is no option to turn off VRS. For those who haven't played the game, or haven't noticed any issues, Digital Foundry's John Linneman pointed out the problem and shared a few examples on <a href="https://twitter.com/dark1x/status/1619264329517522946">Twitter</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-remake-should-look-better-in-the-dark-after-upcoming-update/1100-6510984/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Marvel Snap's Microtransactions Are All Over The Place

<p dir="ltr">Marvel Snap was one of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2022/2900-4517/">favorite games of last year</a>, in part because of its deep easy-to-play, hard-to-master battle mechanics. But it was also a breath of fresh air as a free-to-play game that found an entirely new way to capitalize on its card-collecting backbone, with a unique upgrade path that relied on what you already wanted to do: Collect cool cards and make them look even cooler.</p><p dir="ltr">Snap has exploded in popularity since launch, and we've seen the arrival of many more ways in which we can give developer Second Dinner our money in exchange for cards and credits. And while the game is still in large part unusually fair for a free-to-play mobile game, the sheer variety of in-app purchases means that some of its offerings are great values, and others are simply awful. As a result, it's hard to pinpoint any central philosophy behind the game and its monetization strategy in its current state.</p><p dir="ltr">To understand how the game's monetization works, you first need to understand its core progression. Marvel Snap eschews the traditional randomized card packs of most CCGs, and instead grants you new cards as part of your Collection Level (CL). That level is raised by visually upgrading the cards you already have, with a variety of flourishes like a 3D effect or animated elements. You play to collect boosters for your favorite cards, then upgrade them to look better, which gets you more cards, and the cycle repeats.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snaps-microtransactions-are-all-over-the-place/1100-6510978/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## This Ghostbusters Proton Pack Replica Is One Of The Best Collectibles Of The Year

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092826-protonpackheader.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Since 1984, a proton pack has been one of the most sought-after items on a Ghostbusters fan's wishlist. The primary piece of gear used to wrangle phantoms, if you couldn't buy an undersized toy replica that came with a pool noodle attachment for the neutrona wand in the late 1980s, then you'd have to build one yourself. Fast-forward to late 2021, toy manufacturer Hasbro announced that not only was it going to be producing a replica of the proton pack seen in Ghostbusters: Afterlife, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/life-sized-ghostbusters-proton-pack-replica-announced-by-hasbro/1100-6497560/">but it was going to crowdfund the project</a>.</p><p>The elevator pitch was tempting, as for $400, you'd get a pack that looks like the real deal, sounds authentic, is compatible with the Spengler neutrona wand, and is loaded with plenty of extras thanks to stretch goals being met. Over 20,000 people backed the Hasbro Pulse campaign--including me--and a few weeks ago, proton packs began shipping out. Was it worth it, to spend almost the price of a PS5 on a collectible replica that can look pretty in a corner or be used for an authentic Ghostbusters cosplay?</p><p>You bet your Stay-Puft marshmallows it was.</p><p>What makes this collectible so fantastic is that right out of the box, you're good to go if you're planning to do some Ghostbusters trooping. It's not the first 1:1 scale replica of a proton pack as Anovos had previously offered a $3,000 fiberglass version that could trace its origins back to a screen-used pack and Halloween Costumes is developing its own <a href="https://www.halloweencostumes.com/ghostbusters-proton-pack-costume-replica.html">$500 replica</a>, but the Hasbro-developed version hits that sweet spot for authenticity and price.</p><p>While some sacrifices had to be made for that $400 price tag, this proton pack is easily customizable thanks to some forward-thinking from Hasbro and its engineers. The Ghostbusters community has wasted no time in <a href="https://www.gbfans.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=50507&amp;start=30">making a great prop look even better</a>, and right now, there's no shortage of extras that you can add to the frame or easy modifications that you can do at home.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092820-pack-3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>So where do you get one of these packs? Well that's the bad news, as the crowdfunding campaign is long over and Hasbro hasn't indicated if it'll be doing another run of these packs now that they're out in the wild. With another Ghostbusters movie in development, there could be more than enough interest to roll out a new line of packs eventually, but for now, your only bet is to head to eBay and pay extra for one of these.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092800-protonpack_0003_img_1835.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Points to Hasbro for once again sticking the landing when it comes to packaging, because this box for the proton pack looks exactly like the kind of strongbox that you'd find in Egon Spengler's lair.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092798-protonpack_0017_img_1801.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Switched on and ready to bust some ghosts, Hasbro's proton pack is a good-looking piece of equipment. The weathering isn't entirely perfect here, but as former mythbuster <a href="https://youtu.be/a727MV1HrmY">Adam Savage demonstrated in his video</a>, that's nothing that you can't fix with some easily obtainable supplies. Throw on some more silver paint and brown accents, and this pack will look like it has gone through a few apocalyptic scenarios.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092799-protonpack_0010_img_1809.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The braided cable sheath on this pack is one that can be easily replaced for something more screen-accurate, as Phoebe's pack in Ghostbusters: Afterlife has a more vibrant protective covering. Hasbro's choice here is far more muted and has very messy frayed threads, but if you're looking to swap it out, then a few feet of Techflex neon yellow braided cable is a cheap and easy solution.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092801-protonpack_0009_img_1811.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This red switch here isn't just a handy way to turn the pack on, but an Easter egg that goes all the way back to the original Ghostbusters film. In Afterlife, that Sedgewick Hotel discrepancy was finally addressed when Phoebe field-tested her pack, and now it's a satisfying piece of old-school haptic feedback technology to have on this collectible. Flip the switch, and you'll hear the cyclotron rumble to life inside.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092802-protonpack_0013_img_1805.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>You won't find a real Clippard valve on the pack--not that you can't install one yourself--but this reproduction is the next best thing. It looks like the real deal, has a metal cap, and it's surrounded by a rat's nest of plastic cables that have been molded to look like the copper attachments seen in the film.</p><p>That's a running theme in this pack, as just about every small attachment is made from plastic and rubber, from the Clippard elbow screws down to the Dale resistors. They look great at a glance, and if you want to replace them, that's surprisingly easy to do as well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092803-protonpack_0016_img_1802.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Hasbro did a great job with the decals on this pack, as each sticker looks worn and dirty. They're not metallic vinyl stickers, but for aesthetic purposes, they fit in well with the design of this pack and easily draw your eye towards some of the more interesting mechanical details. If you'd prefer something that doesn't look like it was dragged through a river of corrosive slime, Hasbo did include a sheet of stickers that can be used to give the pack a fresh-out-of-the-workshop look.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092804-protonpack_0011_img_1808.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>You'll find a whole lot of these extra details on the pack, which has seen some interesting evolution in the years since they were first introduced in Ghostbusters. For fans of props that look like they have been extensively used, there's a delightful number of dings, dents, and pitting molded directly into the shell.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092805-protonpack_0014_img_1804.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of the coolest extras on this pack can be found under this part of the shell. Simply unscrew the shock mount, remove the bumper, and...</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092806-protonpack_0007_img_1815.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>...There's the cyclotron, on full display! It looks decent--although I'm planning to give mine a fresh coat of copper paint and better weathering--and inside the rim you'll find two switches. The first switch lets you switch the sounds and lights between Afterlife and Ghostbusters '84 mode, while the second switch will let you switch off the rumble function inside the pack.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092807-protonpack_0008_img_1812.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>There's also a hidden compartment on the side, where you can store some stuff. Or better yet, a small Bluetooth speaker can be inserted here and use to pump out Run DMC's superior Ghostbusters theme from the second film. Sorry Ray Parker Jr., your music is iconic, but Run DMC has the superior track.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092809-proton-pack.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>You can strap on the proton pack right out of the box with the included straps and kidney belt, but if you want this to look authentic, you're going to need to do some shopping at your local military surplus store.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092808-protonpack_0004_img_1831.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Remove those straps, attach an LC-1 Alice frame with the included brackets, add a foam neck roll, and marvel at how much better your pack looks with that extra touch. Plus, this makes it way more comfortable to wear for long stretches as the overall weight is more evenly distributed.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4092811-protonpack_0006_img_1817.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of the other stretch goals for the proton pack was connectivity with the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highly-detailed-ghostbusters-prop-replica-is-made-to-look-poorly-constructed/1100-6482791/"> superb Spengler wand</a>. It attaches easily to the pack and the neutrona wand, and once securely installed, you'll be able to power up the pack from the particle thrower.

<p>Following the massive crossover event from last summer--and running concurrently with the current massive anime crossover feature My Hero Academia--Fortnite and Dragon Ball Super will be joining forces again on January 31.</p><p dir="ltr">Official Fortnite social media accounts posted a single image of a purple spaceship with a familiar symbol flying over the Fortnite island, with the logos of both franchises positioned underneath. No other information is given regarding skins or other cosmetics, but more information will be provided tomorrow.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">1.31.2023 <a href="https://t.co/DwUJieQ9ln">pic.twitter.com/DwUJieQ9ln</a></p>  — Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1620074502985064451?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">January 30, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The symbol on the ship belongs to the Red Ribbon Army, a group of villains that Goku and his friends have been dealing with since the days of the original Dragon Ball.

## SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake Review - F.U.N.

<p dir="ltr">In 2003, SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom was released and became a touchstone for a generation of children already obsessed with the cartoon. While nostalgia plays a large factor, I, like many people around my age, hold that game in high regard, even if the experience doesn't quite hold up all these years later. Now, two decades later, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake has been made as a spiritual successor and, for better and for worse, it plays the way I remember Battle for Bikini Bottom.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Cosmic Shake, SpongeBob and Patrick stumble upon a Mermaid named Kassandra, who sells antique and mysterious items. SpongeBob purchases bubble soap that supposedly grants wishes, running around town and asking everyone he knows for their wishes. Unfortunately, all of the wishes kick in at once, tearing holes in reality and sending the citizens of Bikini Bottom off into the multiverse, with SpongeBob and Patrick left to pick up the pieces.</p><p dir="ltr">This opening sets up the seven levels players will explore throughout the game, each one with a different theme and environment. The aesthetic design of these levels is one of the places The Cosmic Shake shines, pulling together references to iconic episodes of the show, while adding new elements that fit within the game's story. A movie-set-themed episode combines SpongBob's obsession with karate with an action movie, and a pirate level has an enemy ship constantly firing pie bombs at you.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake-review-f-u-n/1900-6418022/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>In what has become a monthly tradition, the next batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers has leaked courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1619696832921366528">billbil-kun</a>. February's PS Plus Essential lineup includes OlliOlli World, Evil Dead: The Game, Mafia: Definitive Edition, and Destiny 2: Beyond Light. An official announcement from PlayStation is expected soon, and all of the freebies should be available to claim starting February 7.</p><p>The leak also noted that Mafia: Definitive Edition might not be available in all regions. If that's the case in your region, billbil-kun claimed a different game would be substituted in Mafia's place.</p><p>February's lineup is rather unique due to the number of games. Over the past couple of years, the standard has been three games each month. February will make the switch back to four freebies, but we wouldn't expect this to become the norm.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-for-february-2023-leaked/1100-6510975/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## New Story Details Revealed For PSVR 2's Horizon Call Of The Mountain

<p>Only a few more weeks remain until PSVR 2 releases, and out of the dozens of titles that'll accompany it in its launch month, Horizon Call of the Mountain is being positioned as the showcase game on that new virtual reality hardware. In a new blog post, Sony has revealed more details on the protagonist of this Horizon spin-off, which features a brand-new lead.</p><p>While the mainline Horizon games stars Aloy, Call of the Mountain will put you in the boots of Ryas, a soldier of a splinter Carja group that was formed during the bloody Red Raids that were ordered by the tyrant Sun-King Jiran. The Carja king's reign lasted until his son Avad overthrew him, and Ryas seeks to atone for his part in this dark history. Call of the Mountain begins with Ryas after he allowed himself to be captured and imprisoned by the Carja, and after being spared from execution, he is recruited by Sun-King Avad and Blameless Marad to investigate a new threat to the lands.</p><p>"Ryas ended up on the wrong side for the right reasons. His family was torn apart, and ultimately, he was incarcerated. This is the story of how he tries to come back from that," Guerrilla's studio narrative director Ben McCaw explained on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/01/30/seeing-the-world-of-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-through-new-eyes">PS Blog</a>. "Having fought for the Shadow Carja, Ryas' relationship with these characters is at best adversarial. He needs to make inroads and amends if he hopes to be accepted."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-story-details-revealed-for-psvr-2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain/1100-6510968/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>There are three certainties in life: Death, taxes, and Avatar: The Way of Water continuing to reign supreme at the domestic box office. For the seventh week in a row, Avatar 2 has stayed at the top of the movie charts and added another $15.7 million to its domestic gross. Combined with international ticket sales, the Avatar sequel has now made over $2.1 billion so far and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-way-of-water-passes-600-million-in-the-us-climbs-to-no-5-all-time-worldwide/1100-6510859/">overtaken Star Wars: The Force Awakens as the fourth-highest-grossing movie of all time</a>.</p><p>Only six movies have made more than $2 billion at the international box office so far, and with Avatar 2 joining their ranks, that list includes three movies directed by Cameron. With Way of Water being a huge success at the box office Cameron is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-2-will-easily-be-profitable-so-james-cameron-is-moving-ahead-with-the-sequels/1100-6510387/">moving ahead with his planned sequels, beginning with Avatar 3 in 2024</a>.</p><p>The rest of the box office top ten saw little change according to <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/2023W04/">Box Office Mojo</a>, even with a few new releases thrown into the mix. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish held firm at second place again, grumpy Tom Hanks climbed to third place in A Man Called Otto, and surprise horror hit M3GAN dropped to fourth place. Indian spy-thriller Pathaan had a fifth place debut, taking in $5.9 million from 695 theaters, horror-mystery Infinity Pool landed in eighth place, and the latest Left Behind film took ninth place overall.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-2-now-no-4-all-time-holds-no-1-for-7th-straight-weekend/1100-6510960/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A film adaptation of PlayStation samurai sandbox Ghost of Tsushima is on the way from John Wick director Chad Stahelski, and while that may sound like a match made in heaven for action fans, don't expect to see that adventure unfold on the big screen for quite a while. In a new interview, Stahelski revealed that Ghost of Tsushima will take a backseat to all the other projects that Stahelski is currently involved in.</p><p>"['Ghost of Tsushima'] would be my favorite to do next. Without going into crazy detail, it's something I'm super-interested in," the John Wick 4 director said to Total Film (via <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1181336/chad-stahelski-shares-an-update-on-his-ghost-of-tsushima-movie/">SlashFilm</a>). "We have a really great script. We have a really good creative team behind it. It's just about getting all the business end of things locked in. It's kind of in that little bit of flux where everybody is trying to tighten up the deal to get everything going, and to make sure we do the best with it. It's a simple thing: getting a great script, and starting to put together a cast. It just takes a lot of moving parts."</p><p>Currently, Stahelski is wrapping up work on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-4-trailer-shows-keanu-reeves-kicking-ass/1100-6509086/">John Wick 4</a>, is developing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-henry-cavill-to-star-in-highlander-reboot-report/1100-6491851/">Highlander reboot</a> that is said to star former Superman Henry Cavill, and also has his hand in several other TV projects. The good news is that when Ghost of Tsushima kicks off production properly, it'll be a project that Stahelski says will create an "epic" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-director-wants-to-make-a-japanese-language-movie-version/1100-6506463/">atmosphere of samurai action</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-wont-be-slicing-up-the-big-screen-anytime-soon/1100-6510961/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Phil Spencer: Xbox Needs "Steady Release Of Great Games," Didn't Do That In 2022

<p>2022 wasn't the best year for Xbox, as Microsoft's gaming division had a very light release schedule. Starfield and Redfall were delayed into 2023, Forza Horizon 5 fans got a new expansion, and Obsidian's Pentiment was the only game released last year that was internally developed. On top of that, Microsoft started the year with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-developer-joseph-staten-is-leaving-343-industries-and-returning-to-xbox-publishing-report/1100-6510677/">massive layoffs</a> that hit Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries.. In a new interview, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer acknowledged that 2022 wasn't a great year for the brand, but that he was feeling much more confident for what 2023 has to offer. </p><p>"Our commitment to our fans is that we need to have a steady release of great games that people can play on our platform, and we didn't do enough of that in 2022, there's no doubt," Spencer said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-interview-2023">IGN</a>. "And fundamentally, that's on me. I'm the head of the business. The commitment we have to our customers to continue to deliver great games is something that I take seriously, the teams take seriously, and 2022 was too light on games. So we're excited about getting to roll into 2023, have the Developer Direct. I felt really good about the games that we were showing."</p><p>The next 12 months are shaping up so far to have a much healthier number of releases for Microsoft. Last week's Developer Direct shadow-dropped Tango Gameworks' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-xbox-game-pass-titles-announced-includes-goldeneye-007-and-hi-fi-rush/1100-6510872/">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/redfall-release-date-confirmed-for-may-2-as-lots-of-new-gameplay-footage-debuts/1100-6510848/">Redfall got a confirmed release date of May 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-is-getting-its-own-xbox-showcase-to-dedicate-the-proper-amount-of-time-to-it/1100-6510477/">Starfield will have its own dedicated showcase soon</a>. Additionally, new updates on Minecraft Legends, the next Elder Scrolls Online expansion, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-motorsport-shows-off-car-fidelity-damage-and-kyalami-grand-prix/1100-6510849/">Forza Motorsport</a> were seen in the Developer Direct, and Spencer mentioned that it was a relief to show off these games with confirmed release dates.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-xbox-needs-steady-release-of-great-games-didnt-do-that-in-2022/1100-6510959/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

With the future of the iconic Xbox franchise unclear, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer gave an update on 343's future without directly mentioning if the developer was working on new single-player content.</p><p>"Every year is critical," Spencer said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-interview-2023">IGN</a>. "I don't find this year to be more or less critical. I feel good about our momentum. Obviously, we're going through some adjustments right now that are painful, but I think necessary, but it's really to set us up and the teams for long-term success. Halo will remain critically important to what Xbox is doing, and 343 is critically important to the success of Halo.

<p dir="ltr">In the latest episode of HBO's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-conversations-are-already-happening/1100-6510880/">The Last of Us</a>, the series took its biggest swing away from existing video game canon yet and, in the process, gave viewers the show's best character development so far. The episode also saw Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Joel (Pedro Pascal) finally hit the road for what is sure to be an interesting road trip.</p><p dir="ltr">Warning: The following contains spoilers for the third episode of HBO's The Last of Us. If you haven't watched yet, head over to HBO Max to stream the episode now.</p><p dir="ltr">In the episode, we learn more about Bill and Frank, the men that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-star-anna-torv-on-that-horrific-episode-2-climax/1100-6510751/">Tess (Anna Torv)</a> advised Joel take Ellie to. What we see, though, is their love story--and it's quite a bit different from the games. In 2013's The Last of Us, we meet Bill and learn about his former partner Frank, a man who took his after being bit when he left Bill. While Frank is never seen in the game (other than as a corpse) he's played by Murray Bartlett (White Lotus) in the series, with Parks and Recreation alum Nick Offerman filling the role of Bill.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbos-the-last-of-us-writers-break-down-bill-and-franks-episode-3-story/1100-6510911/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>We're just three weeks into The Last of Us on HBO, but it's already become clear that the writers aren't afraid to go off-script from the video game's version of events. This latest episode focuses mostly on the relationship between Bill and Frank, characters we never actually see interacting together in the game despite an implied long and somewhat tumultuous history.</p><p>Those pieces of the episode are its best bits, but before we experience the elongated flashback of their time together in Lincoln, Massachusetts, a scene between Ellie and Joel confirms a popular fan theory regarding how the outbreak of the cordyceps fungi began.</p><p>Ellie asks Joel about how it started, essentially wondering who Patient Zero was, and how it spread so fast. According to Joel, who provides a history lesson for both Ellie and the audience, the cordyceps fungus mutated, and he adds that the best guess is it "got into the food supply."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-episode-3-confirms-a-popular-fan-theory-with-a-twist/1100-6510951/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
