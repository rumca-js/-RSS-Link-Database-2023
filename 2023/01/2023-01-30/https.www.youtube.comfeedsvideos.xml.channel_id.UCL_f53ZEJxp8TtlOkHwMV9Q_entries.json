From these four traits, researchers can quantify much of the darkness of humanity, and begin to study it in a way that yields numerical results, and the potential to make substantial predictions.\n\nDr. Delroy Paulhus is a personality researcher whose work in dark personality traits, via a variety of psychometric methods, has yielded measures of the Dark Tetrad. His work has also validated measures of socially desirable responding, perceived control, free will and determinism, and over-claiming. His work has been published in over 150 articles and books, and his current citation count exceeds 43,000.\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBlack Rifle Coffee: Get 10% off your first order or Coffee Club subscription with code JORDAN: https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/\n\nBirch Gold Group: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Dr. Del Paulhus:\n\nWebsite: www.psych.ubc.ca/~dpaulhus/ \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:02) Intro\n(2:50) The big five: where the adjectives come from\n(4:35) What lead Dr. Paulhus to the dark side of psychology\n(8:30) Construct creep\n(10:00) Machiavellianism\n(11:00) Narcissism and Psychopathy\n(12:10) Why these terms are exclusive categories\n(14:30) From Triad to Tetrad: the addition of Sadism\n(19:11) Why human beings are sadistic and predatory\n(25:00) How dark traits are used to attract sexual partners\n(27:00) Hiring people to fire people\n(29:00) When empathy fails you\n(31:50) Women and pornography\n(34:48) Clinical vs. everyday psychology\n(37:40) Virtualization enables darkness\n(39:00) Why sex evolved\n(41:20) Trolls just want to have fun\n(44:20) No one will watch a moderate news channel\n(45:23) The profit motive behind impulsive attention\n(46:50) Anonymity may indicate what people are truly like\n(48:30) Andy Ngo, Antifa, extreme niches\n(54:19) Steve Jobs, when the narcissist is right\n(56:55) Lumpers and splitters\n(1:01:00) Rats, play and social negotiation over time\n(1:05:23) Frans de Waal, leadership in primates\n(1:07:20) Machiavellian mimicry\n(1:10:00) Radical evil, amplified suffering\n(1:13:15) Female sadists\n(1:17:00) The cost of affiliation\n(1:20:05) The Hexaco Model, honesty, and humility\n(1:24:25) When you encounter someone with Dark Tetrad traits\n(1:27:00) You can predict entrepreneurial competence\n(1:31:12) Dimensions of disorders\n(1:34:00) Crunching bugs and voodoo dolls\n(1:38:30) Why study human darkness?\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "title": "Jordan B Peterson"}}
