  <p id="WkqA7R">BMW is recalling almost 3,500 EVs due to issues with the artificial sound generator that’s meant to warn people when the vehicles are backing up or traveling at low speeds. According to the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=23V026000">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website</a>, the recall applies to some 2022 and 2023 BMW i4 and iX models.</p>
<p id="VYB6Ul"><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/49/571.141">Federal safety standards</a> require EVs or hybrids to make a certain amount of noise so that pedestrians can tell that there’s a car coming. Since electric motors are generally pretty quiet, especially at low speeds (the tires will likely be pretty loud on their own when you’re going faster), auto manufacturers usually have their cars make artificial sounds. That often ends up being a futuristic hum or whir; for performance...</p>

  <p id="fRkpoE">Meta is starting to test members-only worlds in <em>Horizon Worlds</em>, its social VR platform, which will allow people to build curated worlds for a select community of users. </p>
<p id="ehCgGI">These members-only worlds will offer something of a middle ground for creators on the platform. You can currently make public worlds for lots of people to go to, and the company is also testing what it calls <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=43993&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fhorizon-worlds-personal-space%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">personal spaces</a>, which function like a private home in VR where you have tight control over who visits. Members-only worlds, on the other hand, are limited to 150 members and 25 concurrent visitors.</p>

  <p id="EcceIf">Even though <strong>Apple’s M1 MacBook Air laptop</strong> is well over two years old, we still highly recommend it, especially when stores like <a href="https://shop-links.co/ciWpPUxvAIY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Best Buy knock its price down to $799.99</a> ($200 off its original price that Apple still sells it for). You probably won’t find a faster, more compact, and better-designed machine for that amount of money. Despite being on the lowest rung and the oldest of Apple’s M1 and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">M2 silicon</a>, don’t count it out. In our review, we came away impressed with its fast performance in most tasks and surprisingly long battery life. That was November 2020, but we still think you’ll be impressed now. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Read our review</a>.</p>
