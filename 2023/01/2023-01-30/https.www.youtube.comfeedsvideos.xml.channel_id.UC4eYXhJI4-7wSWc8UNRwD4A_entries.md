Bob Boilen | January 30, 2023
Hosted by Angélique Kidjo, the series echoes globalFEST’s live flagship event in spirit but is centered in the framework of the Tiny Desk concert series. This collaboration presents exclusive video performances from nine artists filmed in their respective homelands, on the road and in exile all over the world. There will be three nights of concerts, each featuring three bands, on consecutive nights beginning Jan. 24 at 8 p.m. ET. The globalFEST team wrote the following biographical information about each performer.

Khadija El Warzazia’s Bnat el Houariyat & Esraa Warda, Morocco / Algeria / USA
Khadija El Warzazia’s Bnat el Houariyat & Esraa Warda is a pairing composed entirely of women artists: Bnat el Houariyat from the heart of Marrakech performs women’s celebratory and trance music, including chaabi and houara. The group’s percussion and call-and-response singing and complex polyrhythms build into a deeply transporting sonic experience. It is  accompanied by the mesmerizing Algerian-American dancer Esraa Warda, a “rebellious spirit” known for her profound performances of the trance-like jedba hair-swaying dance.

Adams (producer of Tinariwen’s breakout albums and guitarist with Robert Plant) plays with a post-punk guitar approach enriched by his passion for Arabic music and African trance blues, while Durante is a sought-after violinist and percussionist and leader of southern  Italy’s acclaimed Canzionere Grecanico Salentino, who performed its iconic taranta and pizzica dance songs at globalFEST in 2012.
