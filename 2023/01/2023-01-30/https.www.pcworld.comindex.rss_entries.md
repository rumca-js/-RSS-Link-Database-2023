<p>Back in November, Google promised <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/products/gmail/package-tracking/&amp;xcust=2-1-1488030-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">help with tracking shipments</a>&mdash;you know, all the many things we bought as gifts for <s>ourselves</s> loved ones. No need to click through email links or copy and paste tracking numbers into a different website to get details on our package&rsquo;s location. You could just open the shipment notification email to get that info. That feature didn&rsquo;t materialize in time to help us with the deluge of holiday parcels, but it is live now at last.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll have to manually enable package tracking yourself and, for the moment, it&rsquo;s only available on Android and iOS devices through the Gmail app. To turn the feature on, open the Gmail app and tap on the hamburger icon in the upper left. For Android, scroll down and select <em>Settings</em>, then choose an email account. In these account-specific settings, scroll toward the middle of the list to find <em>Package tracking</em> and check the box. For iOS, scroll down to <em>Settings &gt; Data Privacy</em>, then check the box for <em>Package tracking</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="Gmail package tracking in Android app" class="wp-image-1488032" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_20230130-113012.png?w=540" width="270" /><figcaption>Settings in the Android version of the Gmail app.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Now when you open a shipment email, you should see dynamically added information at the top with the delivery status&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s shipped, in transit, or delivered. Don&rsquo;t use the Gmail app on your phone? The web version is presumably just around the corner. In the meanwhile, you can use the downtime to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393978/how-to-clean-up-your-gmail-inbox-by-quickly-deleting-old-email.html">clean up your inbox a little</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but Google Doodles bring me tremendous joy. Google occasionally makes fun alterations to their logo to celebrate holidays, achievements, historical events, and so on. Today&rsquo;s interactive Google Doodle game lets you make delectable <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.tinybubblesteabar.com/love-me-some-bubble-tea&amp;xcust=2-1-1487811-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">bubble tea</a> for your furry friends. The artwork is cute and reminds me of a Studio Ghibli film. Bubble tea also happens to be a guilty pleasure of mine (one of many), so I couldn&rsquo;t wait to jump in and play.</p>

<p>The premise is simple and easy. You&rsquo;re tasked with making different types of bubble tea for an array of customers. You fill the oblong-shaped cup up to the dotted line with tapioca balls (aka boba), milk, and syrup. Some drinks require more tapioca balls than others and if you mess up the measurement, then you&rsquo;ll disappoint the cart owner (cue the sad trombone noise). It&rsquo;s a fun game that&rsquo;ll definitely make you smile. It&rsquo;s also one of the more unique Google Doodle&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve seen in a while and a great celebration of the Taiwanese drink.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re interested, you can read all about the history of bubble tea on Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-bubble-tea&amp;xcust=2-1-1487811-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Doodle page</a>. Although it has deep roots in Taiwanese tea culture, bubble tea really started to take shape in the 1980s. Nowadays, there are so many different flavors and versions of this drink. If you haven&rsquo;t given bubble tea a try yet, you&rsquo;re really missing out!

## Building a tiny PC? This accessory can save your cables from a sad fate

<p>Assembling a small form factor PC is all the rage these days. (Even if some people still like their builds <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1064364/small-form-factor-pcs-suck-and-gordons-tired-of-pretending-they-dont.html">big and burly</a>.) But downsizing can create unexpected problems if you&rsquo;re used to a mid-tower sized case&mdash;like cables getting chewed up by fans.</p>



<p>Ideally, your little case will offer good cable management, but sometimes your components fit together in a way that results in wonky routing. And, if the chassis lacks adequate cable tie-off points, your power or fan cables may end up running a little too close to the fan blades. Cue gnarly sounds and mangled cable sleeves.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="120mm Easycargo-branded fan grills on Amazon" class="wp-image-1477327" height="970" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/amazon-fangrills.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This 4-pack of 120mm fan grills on Amazon costs just $8.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Easycargo / Amazon</p></div>



<p>Thankfully, you can easily fix this problem with an inexpensive accessory: fan grills. They&rsquo;re not used as often in PC builds these days, but you&rsquo;ll find them readily available at the usual stores like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fan+grill&amp;i=electronics&amp;crid=2K3GXNPJLQ4JG&amp;sprefix=fan+grill%2Celectronics%2C137&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;xcust=2-1-1476113-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=8000&amp;d=fan+grill&amp;xcust=2-1-1476113-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Newegg</a>. A multi-pack costs $10 or less.</p>



<p>Installing these with your fans will keep the cables crossing within the narrow interior of a small form factor case safe. Not all SFF cases will need them&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be able to tell after finishing the build if you might need to place an order. You can even go a step further and buy <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.etsy.com/search?q=pc%20fan%20shroud&amp;xcust=2-1-1476113-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">fancy fan shrouds</a>, but that starts to border into pure aesthetics (and thoughtful consideration about effect on airflow). But otherwise, the basic style of fan grill will more than suffice, allowing you to enjoy your build without worry.</p>

## Phony, malicious Bitwarden ads slip past Googleâ€™s watch

<p>Popular password managers like LastPass and 1Password have had <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445758/how-to-export-your-passwords-and-ditch-lastpass.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a rough time of it for the last year</a>, and open-source competitor <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394731/bitwarden-password-manager-review.html">Bitwarden</a> has quickly emerged as an ideal alternative. But with notoriety comes vulnerability: it&rsquo;s the opposite of security through obscurity. Bitwarden has become so popular that it looks like some unscrupulous actors are trying to take advantage of it, and hosting Google ads for phony, presumably malicious downloads masquerading as the security tool. </p>



<p>After users on Bitwarden&rsquo;s company forums and Reddit started seeing suspicious ads (as chronicled by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitwarden-password-vaults-targeted-in-google-ads-phishing-attack/&amp;xcust=2-1-1487690-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bleeping Computer</a>), company representatives have alerted the userbase of the phishing scheme, recommending that people go directly to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://bitwarden.com/download/&amp;xcust=2-1-1487690-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bitwarden download page</a> instead of Googling for it. Those who spot the illegitimate ads should use Google&rsquo;s built-in reporting tools to remove them. </p>

<p>Paying legitimate advertising networks to spread fake information is an indictment of said networks&rsquo; lack of moderation. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221221?=8324278624&amp;xcust=2-1-1487690-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">But it&rsquo;s also nothing new</a>. Earlier this year Google <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1471163/these-fake-amd-radeon-drivers-reveal-a-deeper-google-problem.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ran ads for AMD Radeon drivers</a> that were, in fact, sending users to malware downloads. Google&rsquo;s intentionally vague labeling of text ads, taking the place of the first search results on pretty much every major, lucrative search term, doesn&rsquo;t help. And Google isn&rsquo;t the only guilty party: I&rsquo;ve personally seen similar fakes showing up in high-ranking Microsoft Bing searches, too. </p>



<p>According to user screenshots, the Bitwarden fake is a convincing one, recreating the password manager&rsquo;s login page in a nearly pixel-perfect fashion. The only way to spot the fake was by knowing the genuine URL and comparing it to the phony (&ldquo;bitwardenlogin.com&rdquo;, in this case). Signing into this fake page would give its owners the full login information for your password manager&mdash;a potentially disastrous outcome. Since Bitwarden is becoming a popular tool, and a frequent recommendation for less technically-savvy users, it&rsquo;s disheartening that Google appears to be putting the burden of policing its own advertising network on the backs of regular internet surfers. </p>

<p>No disrespect to Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mspoweruser.com/download-high-resolution-windows-11-default-wallpapers/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">splashy Windows 11 wallpapers</a>, but there&rsquo;s a better way to make your Windows desktop feel more inspiring.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rocksdanister.com/lively/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lively Wallpaper</a> by rockdanister, and it&rsquo;s a free app that transforms your Windows desktop with live, dynamic backgrounds. Lively is an open source project and runner-up for 2022&rsquo;s Microsoft Store App Awards, and it&rsquo;s quickly become one of my favorite apps since installing it last year.</p>



<p>While Lively Wallpaper isn&rsquo;t the only live wallpaper app for Windows, it&rsquo;s the best free option I&rsquo;ve found, and it has one especially neat trick: You can turn any website into a live desktop background, elevating the humble wallpaper from an aesthetic enhancement into a useful tool.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-set-up-lively-wallpaper">How to set up Lively Wallpaper</h2>



<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to decide which version of Lively Wallpaper to install. Most folks should just grab the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NTM2QC6QWS7&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Store app</a>, but you can also <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rocksdanister.com/lively/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">download Lively directly</a> from the developer&rsquo;s website.</p>



<p>While the two versions are mostly the same, some website wallpapers may not display properly without a plugin that only works with the direct download. (More on that shortly.)</p>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve installed the app, double-click the Lively Wallpaper icon from the system tray. The app comes with a dozen live wallpapers out of the box, and clicking any one will set it as your active wallpaper.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Monitor selection in Lively Wallpaper" class="wp-image-1479985" height="812" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livelywallpaperchoosedisplay.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Lively Wallpaper works well with multi-monitor setups.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>You can also try right-clicking on a wallpaper and looking for a <em>Customize</em> option. Some wallpapers, such as the built-in &ldquo;Triangles &amp; Light,&rdquo; let you adjust color, lighting, and other details through this menu, and some can even respond to system audio.</p>



<p>For folks with multiple monitors, Lively lets you set different backgrounds for each display. Click the <em>Active Wallpapers</em> button at the top, then make sure <em>Selected screen only</em> is highlighted to avoid any unwanted wallpaper stretching. You should also check off <em>Always pick screen when choosing wallpaper</em>, which brings up a monitor selector whenever you pick a new background.</p>



<h2 id="turn-websites-into-wallpapers">Turn websites into wallpapers</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Miro whiteboard on the desktop using Lively Wallpaper" class="wp-image-1479984" height="809" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livelymiro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Dynamic wallpapers and looping videos are neat, but Lively&rsquo;s true potential comes from turning websites into desktop backgrounds. This transforms the app from a source of pretty scenery into an endless source of amusement or productivity.</p>



<p>To add a website in Lively, just click the <em>Add Wallpaper</em> button at the top, paste your website into the URL field, then click the arrow button.</p>



<p>Pretty much any website with live, updating information or visuals can make a great background in Lively Wallpaper. Here are some ideas:</p>

<p>By default, website backgrounds will respond to mouse input, but not keyboard controls. To enable the keyboard or disable mouse input, head to <em> Settings </em>(&#9881;)<em> &gt; Wallpaper</em>. Note that enabling the keyboard will also hide your desktop icons.</p>



<p>You may also want to disable audio on whatever website you&rsquo;ve selected. Look for the audio slider under <em>Settings &gt; General</em>.</p>



<h2 id="find-more-live-wallpapers">Find more live wallpapers</h2>



<p>If you want to explore the dynamic wallpaper concept further, there are a few places you can look.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=//www.deviantart.com/livelywallpaper/gallery/)&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lively Wallpaper&rsquo;s DeviantArt gallery</a>, for instance, includes a collection of animated and interactive live wallpapers. (You&rsquo;ll need a DeviantArt account to download the files.) You can also skim through the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/LivelyWallpaper/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lively Wallpaper subreddit</a> for ideas, or check the project&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively/discussions/categories/show-and-tell&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">GitHub discussion page</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lively Wallpaper menu for adding new wallpapers" class="wp-image-1479986" height="812" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livelywallpaperadd.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Build your wallpaper collection with dynamic wallpaper files, videos, and websites</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The app also supports setting videos as wallpapers. Sites like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/loop/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Pexels</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pixabay.com/videos/search/looping/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Pixabay</a> offer looping videos that work well as desktop backgrounds, and if you choose <em>Customize</em> in Lively, you can adjust the playback speed, colors, and saturation.</p>



<p>To add a new wallpaper in Lively, just click the <em>Add Wallpaper</em> button at the top. You can then select a file or use drag and drop.</p>



<p>You can store these wallpapers anywhere, but Lively does offer its own directory, which you can look up under <em>Settings &gt; General &gt; Wallpaper Directory</em>. Any wallpaper files in this directory will be deleted when you remove them from the app, and you can change the directory to move all the wallpapers in it.</p>



<h2 id="a-few-caveats">A few caveats</h2>



<p>Lively Wallpaper is still under active development and has seen a steady stream of improvements over the last year, but it&rsquo;s still not without some rough edges. Some things to be aware of:</p>



<ul><li>Laptop users may want to disable live wallpapers when on battery power. This option is available under <em>Settings &gt; Performance</em>.</li><li>The WebView2 plugin (required for Window Swap, above) seems to have some problems. Web wallpapers may disappear during full-screen applications and fail to load until you remove and re-add them in Lively, and some dynamic wallpapers may fail to work at all.</li><li>Lively Wallpaper is technically capable of running EXE files as wallpapers, which could pair well with visualizer apps such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.plane9.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Plane9</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://codav.itch.io/projectm&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">ProjectM</a>, but so far I&rsquo;ve yet to get either app to work properly.</li></ul>



<p>Also worth noting: My favorite website to use with Lively Wallpaper is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.window-swap.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Window Swap</a>, which shows webcam footage looking out from people&rsquo;s windows around the world. It pairs especially well with multiple monitor setups, as you&rsquo;ll get glimpses of global scenery whenever your extra screens aren&rsquo;t in use.</p>



<p>But getting Window Swap to work has been an ordeal. It requires <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively/wiki/Web-Player&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a separate WebView2 plugin</a>, which in turn doesn&rsquo;t work with the Microsoft Store version of the app. This plugin also seems to prevent some of Lively&rsquo;s dynamic wallpapers from working properly, and playing games in full-screen mode sometimes causes wallpapers to disappear entirely.</p>



<p>For me, though, it&rsquo;s been totally worth it. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rocksdanister.com/lively/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lively Wallpaper</a> is a great resource for anyone who wants to spice up their desktop wallpaper, and with web-based backgrounds, you&rsquo;re only limited by what you can dream up.</p>

<p>The next-generation GPUs from Nvidia and AMD are finally dipping below the $1,000 price point. Prices from both companies are still putting the hurt on gamer wallets and these are no exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The $899 MSRP of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT</a> did not fare well against its much faster $999 Radeon RX 7900 XTX big brother. Nvidia, for its part, had to &ldquo;relaunch&rdquo; the RTX 4080 12GB as the $100-cheaper <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html">$799 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti</a> after a terrible reception to the original version. As you can see, both parties have an uphill battle to gain your gaming dollar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about the price, gaming performance, and vital things to be aware of. Both GPUs promise to give you excellent 1440p performance, together with next-gen tech such as ray tracing, FSR, and DLSS 3. Is the &ldquo;sky high&rdquo; pricing too much to stomach, or can one of these graphics&rsquo; powerhouses convince you to part ways with your hard-earned cash? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-vs-amd-rx-7900-xt-price">Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT: Price</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT" class="wp-image-1483250" height="610" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_20230120_104332.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Good news: You can readily find both the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and Radeon 7900 XT in stock across most retailers. Bad news: You&rsquo;re not going to like the price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The $899 AMD 7900 XT came out first, and its performance seems rather cut down in comparison to the much more powerful <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">Radeon RX 7900 XTX</a> at just $100 more. The 7900 XTX has been much more difficult to find in stock, leading many buyers with only the 7900 XT as an option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html">Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti</a>, priced at $799, is a $100 discount from its initial conception: a $899 RTX 4080 12GB. After Nvidia&rsquo;s unusual change of plans, we&rsquo;re left with the RTX 4070 Ti as the cheapest next-generation option. Keep in mind the RTX 3070 Ti was $599, so this is a hefty $200 bump in price after one generation (and the 3070 Ti was a terrible value in its own right).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another key takeaway from MSRP pricing: There will be far more RTX 4070 Ti&rsquo;s available at $849 and above, rather than the base $799 MSRP. The Nvidia add-in board partners have historically lower margins, so they&rsquo;re happy to sell you an upgraded &ldquo;Overclocked&rdquo; model for an upcharge. There is also no &ldquo;Founders Edition&rdquo; version such as with the other RTX 40 series GPUs from Nvidia. Those have traditionally been priced at base MSRP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s 7900 XT can typically be found a little bit easier for its $899 MSRP, but the same market forces can lead to its partner models being more expensive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, gamers are not especially happy with the pricing on either product&mdash;showcased by their ample availability on store shelves.</p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-vs-amd-rx-7900-xt-performance">Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT: Performance</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT" class="wp-image-1483254" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-13-at-3.58.44-PM.png?w=1175" width="1175" /><figcaption><p><em>The 7900 XT (middle) is tiny compared to the RTX 4080!</em></p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Both GPUs make the most sense at 1440p, but they can certainly perform at 4K resolutions with some caveats.&nbsp;Brad Chacos brought up a great point in his <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html">Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti review</a>: The RTX 4070 Ti only has 12GB of VRAM with a much slower memory bus width&mdash;which can bottleneck in some 4K titles. The Radeon RX 7900 XT, with its ample 20GB of VRAM, won&rsquo;t have this issue. That&rsquo;s certainly a nice advantage on the hardware side for AMD.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT" class="wp-image-1483260" height="1038" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cyberpunk-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>results for RTX 4070 Ti and RX 7900 XT.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>Starting with native <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>(ray tracing and DLSS/FSR off), the RTX 4070 Ti suffers a serious defeat against the RX 7900 XT. At 1440p, the 102fps of the former is blown out of the water by the 121fps of the 7900 XT. That&rsquo;s a whopping 17 percent frames-per-second difference, and the 7900 XT is only 11 percent more expensive. 4K also goes to the 7900 XT&mdash;with 61fps beating 49fps. In other words, only the 7900 XT hits the magical 4K 60fps threshold in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT" class="wp-image-1483261" height="1038" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/codmw2-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> results for RTX 4070 Ti and RX 7900 XT.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>Next up is the new <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>. AMD GPUs have been doing great in this game, and the 7900 XT is no exception. The 4070 Ti has one of its worst defeats here, with massive fps chasms between them. 1440p shows us 178fps versus 130fps, with the 7900 XT taking a dominating lead. The other resolutions are similar&mdash;it&rsquo;s not even close.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If this is one of your favorite games, it&rsquo;s obvious that AMD does huge numbers here&mdash;even the older 6900 XT isn&rsquo;t too far off the 4070 Ti&rsquo;s  pace! If the <em>Call of Duty</em> series is your forte, you&rsquo;ll likely skew towards AMD as the GPU of choice.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT" class="wp-image-1483266" height="1038" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/RT-cyberpunk-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> results with ray tracing for RTX 4070 Ti and RX 7900 XT.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and this time with ray tracing. Nvidia&rsquo;s hardware has a big advantage in ray tracing. Here, we finally see the RTX 4070 Ti score a victory. At 1440p, both GPUs dip below 60fps with ray tracing on. The RTX 4070 Ti maintains (kind of) playable 48fps, which is more than the 37fps the RX 7900 XT can muster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether ray tracing is &ldquo;worth it&rdquo; to you is subjective&mdash;but when implemented well, it does offer some beautiful effects. Other times, it&rsquo;s not as noticeable. One thing that isn&rsquo;t subjective: The performance penalty that it imposes on hardware.</p>



<p>A big answer to that is Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS, and AMD&rsquo;s FSR upscaling technologies. These promise higher frame rates, while allowing you to tick on more of the eye candy. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, this brings the RTX 4070 Ti to a more palpable 88fps. Likewise, the balanced setting also brings the RX 7900 XT to 70fps&mdash;much more playable, but well behind Nvidia&rsquo;s GPU. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> will also implement DLSS 3 in the future&mdash;which should bring even more frames to the table with Nvidia&rsquo;s Ai frame generation tech. AMD also has FSR 3 in the pipeline, but currently only FSR 2.1 works with <em>Cyberpunk</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To sum up the performance on hand here: The AMD RX 7900 XT has a big lead over the RTX 4070 Ti in regular rasterized performance. This means when ray tracing and DLSS are switched off, the pure brute force of the 7900 XT will wipe the floor with the RTX 4070 Ti. The ray tracing performance of the 7900 XT isn&rsquo;t terrible, either&mdash;it still lags behind, but has come a long way this generation.</p>



<p>If you factor in ray tracing and DLSS 3, especially if the game you play supports it, that may balance the conversation more. The $100 cheaper price of the Nvidia GPU is also a plus, but we can&rsquo;t ignore the performance of the 7900 XT&mdash;it&rsquo;s the clear winner for this category.</p>

<p>Efficiency matters when you&rsquo;re putting out several hundred watts of performance. The Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti takes the cake here, with a 285W TDP compared to the 300W TDP of the 7900 XT. Overall, both are fairly close, as per Brad Chacos&rsquo;s graph below. The 7900 XT does offer better performance in general, so it wins out on that front. The 4070 Ti does have DLSS 3 in some titles, where it can really perform well&mdash;but that&rsquo;s a narrower use case. When looking at the 450W TDP of the RTX 3090 Ti, both GPUs certainly impress with their efficiency gains.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs AMD RX 7900 XT" class="wp-image-1483269" height="1038" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/power-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>Power draw results for RTX 4070 Ti and RX 7900 XT.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>Better efficiency means smaller GPU cooler designs, right? Sort of&mdash;but not always. The reference AMD RX 7900 XT has a svelte cooler, with only double 8-pin PCIe power. Third-party add-in board (AIB) models can have much larger coolers, however. The RTX 4070 Ti does not have a &ldquo;Founders Edition&rdquo; version made by Nvidia, so you&rsquo;re stuck with the AIB coolers. Some have similar designs to the large RTX 4080-style versions, so you&rsquo;ll typically still be dealing with some big brawlers here.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about any thermal issues, both GPUs typically run very cool. The reference 7900 XT was not affected by some of the quality-control issues that plagued the bigger 7900 XTX&rsquo;s reference-only coolers, so nothing to worry about here. Likewise, the power adapters on the RTX 4070 Ti are also fine. Just remember to plug them in carefully and thoroughly (the RTX 4090&rsquo;s issues were found to simply be users not fully inserting the adapter all the way in).</p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-vs-amd-rx-7900-xt-verdict">Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT: Verdict</h2>



<p>It&rsquo;s hard to argue against some of the performance that both GPUs are putting out&mdash;especially at 1440p and 4K.&nbsp; Efficiency is also impressive, putting last-generation top-dog GPUs to shame.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the 7900 XT is certainly the performance favorite here for most titles without ray tracing, it&rsquo;s hard to crown a true winner. GPU pricing has rapidly reached prices that seem downright unreasonable. The RTX 4070 Ti does offer decent ray tracing goodies and DLSS 3 can be huge if the game you&rsquo;re playing supports it. At $799, it&rsquo;s cheaper than the 7900 XT, but we&rsquo;re starting off at an already exorbitant price level, which makes it unappealing. The $999 7900 XTX looks much better than either for your dollars, but it&rsquo;s also more expensive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So there&rsquo;s no clear winner here. We&rsquo;d suggest waiting a bit for prices to stabilize, as it&rsquo;s been a tumultuous time. Nvidia and AMD are still reacting on-the-fly to the overabundance of previous-generation GPUs still needing to be cleared out of inventory. This clearly has had an impact on next-gen pricing. </p>



<p>This is an &ldquo;out of the ordinary&rdquo; transition period, and we know saying to just &ldquo;wait it out&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t always a viable option for those needing a GPU now&mdash;but now you have the information you need to make a smart purchase if you do need a new GPU right now..&nbsp;</p>



<p>With more GPU releases this year encompassing the rest of the lineup, we may also see better pricing to do more availability. You may want to hold on to your current GPU for just a little longer&mdash;things should improve.</p>
