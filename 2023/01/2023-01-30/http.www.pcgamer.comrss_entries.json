creatures on the black sands of Purgatory and sell their gold-stained corpses to craven priests,\" <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016360/PERISH/\" target=\"_blank\">Perish</a>&apos;s description on Steam begins. \"Kill magnificent bosses and use the proceeds to gain access to Elysium, a place of cosmic revelations.\" Say no more, I&apos;m in.</p><p>Every frame of this co-op FPS looks like it could be metal album art\u2060\u2014it&apos;s inspired by Greek mythology, but feels extremely fresh. Instead of white marble columns and clean Corinthian helms, everything&apos;s <em>greasier</em> in Perish, its gold color palette conferring a real sickly quality. It&apos;s raining blood in the second area of Perish&apos;s free demo, and my favorite shot of its Steam trailer shows an alien sky with multiple moons beyond a series of floating ruins. <em>This stuff&apos;s rad</em>.</p><p>I unlocked a gun pretty quick in the demo, but I just couldn&apos;t put down the starting hatchet weapon. Similar to Fatshark&apos;s offerings, developer Item42&apos;s really nailed the feeling of crunchy, effective melee weapons, and I&apos;m especially jazzed about the infinitely respawning grappling hook javelins and beam-launching <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khopesh\" target=\"_blank\">khopesh</a> sword shown off in the trailers.</p><p>Perish has set maps with variable objectives, a setup similar to other co-op shooters. You can accumulate gold to unlock permanently available weapons and modifiers for your character, as well as earn randomized temporary bonuses as you complete the stages of a mission. One stage had me chasing down a slippery target before holding down an objective for time, while another required me to trade in my hatchet for a slow-swinging torch and burn down a temple.</p><p>The objectives are fun and distinct enough from one another, and I was having plenty of fun tackling Perish&apos;s demo solo. If you&apos;re luckier than me and have friends who <em>aren&apos;t</em> adults with jobs and no time for co-op indie shooters, all the better\u2060\u2014Perish seems like a real winner for two to four player co-op.
