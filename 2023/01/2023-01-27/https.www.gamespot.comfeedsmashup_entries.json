Kofi Kingston, Santos Escobar, Ricochet, Austin Theory, Seth Rollins, Bobby Lashley, Baron Corbin, Rey Mysterio, Gunther, Cody Rhodes, and Omos have all staked their claim for the men's match. Liv Morgan, Candice LeRae, Rhea Ripley, and Raquel Rodriguez will participate in the women's match, with the latter making her Rumble debut.</p><p>The 36th Royal Rumble is scheduled to be held on Saturday, January 28, 2023, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas as part of the Alamodome's 30th-anniversary celebration. The winner of the Rumble gets an automatic title shot at Wrestlemania against a champion of their choosing. It's unclear at this time if the winner of the men's gets to choose an individual title or the collective Undisputed Universal Championship that Roman Reigns has held for almost a year.</p><p>The Rumble is also used to introduce new stars to the WWE audience as well as for current performers to make their return after a long absence. We know that Cody Rhodes is coming back after almost seven months away recovering from a torn pectoral muscle, but who else could make their way to the ring and shock the WWE Universe? Here are nine stars who could appear and walk that aisle to the Rumble.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>John Cena</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4092261-john-cena-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>A two-time Rumble winner, Big Match John recently celebrated over 20 years with WWE and will be the face and focus of WWE 2K23. It's been five years since we've seen Cena make a Rumble appearance and the \"face that runs the place\" is past due to take one last shot at Wrestlemania glory.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bad Bunny</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4092262-035_raw_02082021ej_20985--961fb7b9c7659974b5d4a2e841b52112.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>One of the top-selling musicians of the decade, Bad Bunny has been showcased more in WWE programming, even shown walking around in the latest WWE 2K23 commercial. He's had a number-one song titled Booker T, named after the WWE Hall of Famer, and even participated in a match at Wrestlemania 37. A Rumble appearance feels more than likely at this point.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bron Breakker</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4092263-bron_breakker_bio--881f838e6bcdb47ac0cf3d5fab0774f4.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The son of WWE Hall of Famer and tag team legend Rick Steiner, Bron made a name for himself as a singles star at the beginning of NXT 2.0, quickly winning the NXT Championship. Being in NXT doesn't disqualify a competitor from being in the Rumble as other NXT stars have been seen throughout the years, including Adam Cole in his only Rumble appearance in 2018.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>\"Switchblade\" Jay White</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4092265-l0gyhnrq5cgoyz67t32x.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>If it's January, it must be \"Jay White to WWE\" month. For the past three years, Bullet Club leader Jay White has teased making the jump, and every year wrestling fans work themselves up thinking this will definitely be the year, but it never is. What if it is this year, though? White's contract with New Japan Pro Wrestling is up this month, and WWE and NJPW have formed a working relationship recently, so don't be too shocked if the Catalyst of Professional Wrestling shows up.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>\"Demon\" Finn Balor</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4092266-maxresdefault%2812%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The dark side of the Judgment Day leader hasn't been seen in almost two years, and the Rumble is primetime for a return. The former two-time NXT Champion and first Universal Champion hasn't had much luck in the Rumble match itself, or main eventing for a title, but Demon Balor has yet to make a Rumble appearance.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ric Flair</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4092267-ric-flair-1068x570.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> Ric Flair is a legend in his own time. During his 50-year career he's become a recognized 16-time world champion, five-time United States Champion, the oldest Intercontentinal Champion, and Tag Team Champion. He was recently seen on Raw Is XXX and you should never count the Nature Boy out. If the Flair enters, he would undoubtedly be the oldest Rumble entrant of all time at 73 years old. Flair won the Rumble back in 1992 for the vacated WWE Championship and drew #3, the lowest entrant to win the Rumble at the time, and a record that would go unbeaten for three years until Shawn Michaels drew the dreaded #1 slot but emerged victorious.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Undertaker</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4092271-the-underaker-on-wwe-raw-30th-anniversary.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>One of the most iconic WWE stars of all time has done it all, including a former Rumble victory back in 2007--the first time a #30 entrant won--and multiple championships in his 30-year career. The Dead Man has always done well in the Rumble and still holds the second-most career eliminations at 44.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Zack Ryder</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4092272-zack_ryder_bio--aaa9b91391dc2c789441fd00e5fcded1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> Since being released from WWE in 2020, Matt Cardona has won numerous championships across a slew of companies, including a brief reign as NWA Worlds Heavyweight Champion. It was recently reported that Cardona had officially trademarked his former ring name Zack Ryder, so it seems that a Rumble return could be on the horizon. You know it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Randy Orton</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4092277-mm2kqj12xm23b0vmvojh.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The two-time Royal Rumble winner and 14-time world champion has been out of action since last year. Orton's full-time return is looking doubtful, with reports of a severe back injury making an imminent return unlikely. However, should the future Hall of Famer make his Rumble return, fans would assuredly pop big for the 20-year veteran.</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-fallout-4-realism-mod-makes-the-game-much-shorter-and-impossible-to-survive/1100-6510936/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "This Fallout 4 Realism Mod Makes The Game Much Shorter And Impossible To Survive", "date_published": "2023-01-27 19:22:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Fallout 4's depiction of the nuclear post-apocalypse is a reasonably realistic one--in that it's hell on Earth--but there are a few inconsistencies in the opening minutes that Neil DeGrasse Tyson would have a field day with.

As technology evolves and the scope of knowledge in the world grows, so too do our expectations. Even the most innovative games' popularity will generally dwindle over time, as newer releases build on their predecessors' successes to bring a better, fresher experience to the table. However, a select few--games like <i>Tetris, Scrabble</i>, and Chess--are so pure and perfected in the fundamentals of their gameplay that they're essentially timeless in their appeal, and have maintained their popularity over the years as a result. <a href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en\">Magic: The Gathering</a><i> </i>is an example of such a game.</p><p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of the release of the original trading card game.

No spot is ever truly safe from interlopers, and sometimes the loot is gonna be trash. But while you can't control your loot luck or where other people drop, you <em>can</em> take care to at least put yourself in the best available position most of the time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When I'm choosing a landing zone on the fly, I usually go with one of two options: the fringe of a major named location, or the middle of one of the larger unnamed locations. And what I try to never, ever do is land smack in the heart of a big place of interest (POI), because it's far too easy for things to go sideways when you're right in the middle of the action.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The point of those guidelines is I want to drop someplace that will have enough loot for my crew and I, but I want to avoid landing in a spot where a lot of people might shoot me from every direction within seconds of landing. So with that in mind, I've assembled a list of eight specific spots that have given me the best odds of not getting wiped as soon as my squad lands.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Anvil Square's castle tower</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4091299-anvilwithmap.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Anvil Square is my favorite location on the new map, but my drops there tend to go very badly if I'm not able to land at the big castle parts on the north side of town. Ideally landing on top of the tower on the western end of the structure. But this spot is no hidden gem--you're probably not gonna be the only one going for it. But if you can hit it first or otherwise win the landing there, you'll be able to gear up very quickly with minimal immediate threats from the rest of town. But if the tall part of the castle looks too hot, the shorter end of the structure to the east should work in a pinch.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Fridgeberg, the small group of medieval houses with a reboot van north of Anvil Square</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4091300-fridgebergwithmap.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">If the competition at Anvil Square looks heavier than you wanna deal with, you can always bail a little bit northwest to this small group of medieval houses surrounding a reboot van. It's never my first choice, but since it's right in the middle of the map it's a convenient and effective drop spot for when you abort your landing plans for Anvil or other central-ish locations. Considering Anvil Square is easily the hottest POI on the Chapter 4 map, that's gonna happen sometimes.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Crude Harbor</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4091294-crudeharborwithmap.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>While the snowy part of the map isn't exactly dense with major locations (only having two that warrant names on the map so far), but it's also rife with minor locations that are fairly robust. My favorite of these is (name), the docks on the far north edge of the map. This has been one of my preferred spots for a quiet start--in my experience it's pretty rare for others to drop there unless the battle bus goes right over it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Citadel, at the southernmost vending machine</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4091295-citadelwithmap.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Citadel is such a maddening labyrinth that it isn't usually super busy at the start of a match anyway. But I like this vending machine along the southern wall of the main courtyard for the quick gun and ammo, and because you can very easily disappear into the belly of the castle or just flee the place entirely from there.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The big front entrance of Brutal Bastion</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4091296-brutalbastionwithmap.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Most folks go directly inside the buildings when landing at Brutal Bastion, so I prefer to start outside. On the southern end of town there's a big entrance with a bridge in front of it. On the south end of the bridge is usually at least one chest and one gun on the floor, and under the bridge is a vending machine and a secret room with several Slurp kegs and a buried chest. While there are usually enemies pretty close, I almost always have a minute or two to gear up when I land on that bridge.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Hitches and Ditches, the gas station/trailer park north of Frenzy Fields</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4091297-hitchesandditcheswithmap.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Fortnite Chapter 4 map doesn't really have a spot that we would refer to as \"The Gas Station\" like we would with the truck stop near Rocky Reels in Chapter 3. But this gas station north of Frenzy Fields, which is accompanied by a trailer park across the street, is the best non-major drop location in the middle of the map. It's not usually busy since it's not a named POI, but the trailer park usually has a surprisingly large amount of loot. My crew tends to be pretty well equipped when we drop here, and there's usually enough vehicles around for each squad member to have their own.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Meadow Mansion, west of Frenzy Fields</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4091298-meadowmansionwithmap.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>If you're in a squad, Frenzy Fields is probably the toughest named landing spot on the map because the buildings are spread out and none of them ever have enough loot for more than two people at best. With one exception: the big mansion to the west of all the farm buildings, which has enough loot for everybody. You should expect to have to do battle against at least one other team for it, but it's a much better place for a fight than any other spot in Frenzy Fields. And there's a reboot van right there if you need it after the dust settles.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The barber shop and gas station at Slappy Shores</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4091302-slappywithmap.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Slap factory at Slappy Shores is a nightmare that I usually try to avoid, but the row houses on the north side of the river also tend to turn into a huge mess at the start of a match. But to the west of those houses, on the edge of the northwestern corner of town, is a purple, two-story barbershop and a gas station that have become my go-tos when we decide to get Slappy. While the loot there isn't always amazing, the med machine at the gas station picks up some of the slack. And your foes will probably be too busy setting houses on fire to try to kill each other to look your way, which means plenty of opportunities to third-party them if that's your game.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Breakwater Bay, but across the bridge from the main part of town</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4091293-breatkwaterbaywithmap.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>For the first month or so of the new chapter I thought Breakwater Bay was cursed. My team could rarely get any traction there, usually getting killed pretty quickly, and I was ready to completely give up on it as a landing spot. But then we shifted to landing across the bridge to the east, at the medieval houses away from the heavy action around the control point. We're usually able to loot in relative peace here before jumping into the fray at our leisure.</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfl-qb-joe-burrow-reveals-hes-a-ness-main-in-smash-bros/1100-6510947/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "NFL QB Joe Burrow Reveals He's A Ness Main In Smash Bros.", "date_published": "2023-01-27 18:52:00+00:00", "description": "<p>NFL QB Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals is a big fan of Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. series, and specifically Ness.
