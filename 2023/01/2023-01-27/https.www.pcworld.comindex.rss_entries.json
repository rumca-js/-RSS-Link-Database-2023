You can perform searches that you want to keep from affecting your recommendations or appearing in your search history&mdash;which applies as much to tax information and medical questions as anything more scintillating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now on all phones and tablets, you can protect your incognito tabs from prying eyes by locking them down. A quick tweak to Chrome settings on iOS and Android makes biometric or PIN authentication required to view your private tabs whenever you leave the app and then return. It&rsquo;s an extra layer of protection for when you forget to close a tab when you&rsquo;re done&mdash;easy to do if you&rsquo;re constantly hopping between apps. No need to worry about banking info sitting unguarded, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trying to feature out for yourself is easy. If it&rsquo;s rolled out to your Android device (or if you&rsquo;re only now trying it on your iPhone or iPad), just tap on the three dot menu in Chrome, then <em>Privacy and Security</em>. Toggle on <em>Lock Incognito Tabs When You Close Chrome</em>. Now when you switch away from Chrome and then come back, you&rsquo;ll have to pass an authentication check before you can see and interact with those private tabs again.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Settings for Locking Incognito Tabs in Chrome on iOS\" class=\"wp-image-1486704\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_2741.png?w=554\" width=\"277\" /><figcaption>Flipping the toggle is all you need to do to enable this feature.

I leave my incognito windows open on PC for long stretches way more often than on a phone or tablet. I haven&rsquo;t yet met a browser window stuffed with tabs that I didn&rsquo;t like to keep around. And sometimes I&rsquo;m reading up on something I don&rsquo;t want roommates to know about; other times, I have private correspondence I&rsquo;m working on that I really don&rsquo;t want to be seen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can always lock my PC, but I occasionally forget to slam my fingers on <code>Win + L</code> before dashing off to deal with an overflowing pot or vomiting cat. The best alternative is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394374/5-security-tools-built-into-windows-10.html\">setting up Dynamic Lock in Windows</a>, but that only works if you move far enough away from your computer to trigger the auto-lock.

It&rsquo;s true that it can be a bit of a cat-and-mouse game between streaming services and VPN providers to continually provide access to their content, but it&rsquo;s still entirely possible with the right VPN. That&rsquo;s why choosing your VPN carefully is essential in order to stream when outside the country. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the restrictions by services such as Netflix&rsquo;s towards VPNs, you need to choose a service that has active compatibility with that streaming site. This can provide some assurance that the VPN is committed to adapting its strategies in accordance with any access restriction updates by these websites. Also, its a good idea to choose a VPN with good overall server spread so that if one server is down in the country you are trying to access, there are other options available as well. The PCWorld staff have thoroughly tested the top VPNs on the market for their ability to bypass region locks across multiple servers and we&rsquo;ve curated our favorites in the list below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We highly recommend that you use a VPN not only to access location restricted content, but also to provide one of the best upgrades to your online security. So, if you&rsquo;re looking to use your VPN for more than streaming, be sure to check out our comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html\">roundup of the best VPNs</a> in all categories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated 01/23/2023:</strong> Check out our latest review of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407502/ipvanish-vpn-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IPVanish</a>.

This company has been challenging the Netflix VPN ban from the start. It&rsquo;s also had a goal of making all of its servers work with the streaming service. As of this writing, this is the case. No matter which Netflix catalog you want, NordVPN promises to deliver it. </p>\n\n<p>NordVPN has more than 5,000 servers and offers locations in 60 countries around the world. It also allows you to choose your specific server so that you can switch around if you need to when Netflix&rsquo;s ban hammer comes down.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to top-notch speeds, and Netflix compatibility, NordVPN offers double-hop connections, and VPN over TOR. NordVPN also uses the WireGuard protocol by default, though it has made some modifications to make WireGuard friendlier and more private for commercial VPN services and thus calls its protocol NordLynx.</p>\n\n<p>NordVPN is inside our top 10 for best speeds overall, and it should have no trouble streaming Netflix anywhere in the world.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398777/nordvpn-review-3.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Review NordVPN</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"2-expressvpn-best-runner-up-for-netflix\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.

While Netflix produces a lot of its own content that it can make available worldwide, the company also licenses a ton of content from traditional entertainment studios. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These third parties are still working on a system of global territory licensing. Under this system, Netflix gets a package of movies and TV shows from these companies that it can show in the U.S., but that aren&rsquo;t licensed to be shown by Netflix in, say, Europe. To keep those companies and their other international licensees happy, Netflix must enforce a block on VPNs to prevent people from getting content made available to Netflix subscribers in the UK, but not the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are making progress in licensing content across the world,&rdquo; Netflix said in a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://about.netflix.com/en/news/evolving-proxy-detection-as-a-global-service&amp;xcust=2-1-618517-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">2016 blog post</a>. &ldquo;But we have a ways to go before we can offer people the same films and TV series everywhere.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Netflix isn&rsquo;t the only company that has to enforce these restrictions. Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and others do it too. However, Netflix along with Hulu are easily the most active and effective at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"buying-vpn-access-for-netflix-streaming\">Buying VPN access for Netflix streaming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already covered this in brief, but let&rsquo;s quickly deal with what you should be looking for in a Netflix VPN. First, most people should not make speed the top consideration. The minimum recommended bandwidth for a 1080p Netflix stream is 5 megabits per second (Mbps). If you&rsquo;re streaming in 4K it&rsquo;s 15Mbps. That&rsquo;s nothing, and nearly all the top VPNs hit those speeds quite easily in most places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, the first consideration should be the basic promise of Netflix compatibility from a reputable company. That&rsquo;s the rub. Any old VPN can promise Netflix compatibility, but if there aren&rsquo;t a lot of reviews about the service it may not be the real deal. Stick to well-known VPN services if you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you need to consider how many servers are available for the service&ndash;especially the number in your target country. If you want Netflix Australia and the VPN only has two Australian servers, that could be a problem. Most of the popular VPN services list their server networks online that show you how many servers are in each country. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, make sure the VPN&rsquo;s desktop app (and don&rsquo;t forget about mobile) allows you to choose specific servers. Since this is a cat-and-mouse game you need a service with a number of servers in your desired Netflix country. That way if one server has been discovered by Netflix, it&rsquo;s possible the others are still working. Often, just switching servers is enough to keep watching, and sometimes even simply reconnecting to the same server is enough to fix streaming issues. That&rsquo;s the one word of warning we&rsquo;d offer to anyone looking to play the international Netflix game. You will have to get used to occasional interruptions. Sometimes this can mean access to U.S. Netflix from overseas is blocked on a particular VPN entirely, though this often only lasts a day or two. Slightly more frequent interruptions may happen, where the stream will just stop. The fix for this is often just switching servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after all of that, consider speeds. Speeds for countries in North America and Europe are usually solid in the major VPN services. Australia and Asia can vary wildly, however. Any of our recommendations in this article will give you the speeds you need in those areas of the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-we-tested\">How we tested</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We only test on days that the wired internet connection hits 80Mbps or more. During the daily test we measure the speeds of five different locations around the world, running the test three times in each location and taking the average speed of each country for the day, and then we average those speeds again to get an overall daily average. Our countries are typically, but not always, the U.S., UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The daily test is run on three different days at three different times of the day. We then take each daily average, and then average them again to get an overall average. We then determine that overall average as a percentage of the original daily speed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason we don&rsquo;t bother with printing hard numbers as a rule is that experiences in hard numbers can vary wildly. It all depends on the speed of your internet connection, the time of day, and even device types can have an impact. For that reason we feel that percentages, which can show how much speed you can expect to lose on a given service, is a more useful indicator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Netflix is an excellent service, and while the company doesn&rsquo;t like you to use VPNs, we&rsquo;ve never heard of anyone being penalized because of it. Just choose your preferred VPN service wisely and you&rsquo;ll be good to go. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-vpn\">What is a VPN?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>A VPN (Virtual private network) encrypts your internet traffic and disguises your identity while browsing the internet. When used for streaming Netflix, a VPN will reroute your traffic from your location outside the U.S. to their own server within the country masking your true location and allowing you to bypass Netflix&rsquo;s region locks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, VPNs anonymize your internet traffic and keep your ISP from potentially snooping on your browsing.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 id=\"are-vpns-legal\">Are VPNs legal?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Yes! In most countries, including the United States, using a VPN is legal. Some websites such as Netflix might try to block VPN connections due to their own personal restrictions, but they are still perfectly fine to use. Please note, while using a VPN is legal, some of the activities done <em>while using</em> a VPN might be illegal. Activities such as downloading pirated copyrighted content or accessing dark web markets are both illegal with and without a VPN.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 id=\"will-a-vpn-affect-my-internet-speeds\">Will a VPN affect my internet speeds?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>In short, yes, a VPN can have an effect on your internet speeds. But nowadays it&rsquo;s the exception rather than the norm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While connected to a VPN, your traffic is rerouted through the VPN provider&rsquo;s own servers. Depending on where these servers are located, it can add extra distance for your traffic to travel to and from, slowing your speeds down a bit. Also, VPNs encrypt your data which can lead to slower download and upload speeds due to the time it takes to encrypt and decrypt your data. This can have a more significant impact on speeds and it can affect everything from page load times to video buffering speeds. Thankfully, modern VPN providers have taken advantage of advances in encryption technology and server optimization to drastically reduce these impacts.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">4.</span>\n<h3 id=\"do-vpns-track-my-browsing-or-store-my-data\">Do VPNs track my browsing or store my data?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>This is entirely up to the VPN provider you choose to use. There have been instances in the past of VPN providers collecting data on their users. However, these were mainly free VPN services with no explicit &ldquo;no-logging&rdquo; policies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When searching for a VPN, be careful to check the company&rsquo;s website for a &ldquo;no-logging&rdquo; policy, third-party trust verification, and trustworthy user reviews. Thankfully, most of the major paid VPNs have clearly stated &ldquo;no-logging&rdquo; policies, so it&rsquo;s typically best to stick with one of them if you have concerns.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Interested in using your VPN for more than just streaming Netflix, check out some of our other best VPN roundups to learn more:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/616724/fastest-vpn.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fastest VPN 2022: Speedy performers ranked</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/625994/best-vpn-for-fire-stick.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best VPN for Amazon Fire Stick</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/622728/best-vpn-for-gaming.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best VPN for gaming 2022: Expert picks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/624123/the-best-vpn-for-torrenting.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best VPN for torrenting 2022: Top picks tested and ranked</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nStreaming Media</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1476101/how-to-add-screensaver-images-to-your-kobo-e-reader.html", "title": "How to add custom screensaver images to your Kobo e-reader", "date_published": "2023-01-27 17:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Kindles, Kobo e-readers don&rsquo;t have generic screensavers appear on screen when in standby mode.

(Kobo has not published official documentation on this process&mdash;rather, the knowledge lives primarily in the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=321609&amp;xcust=2-1-1476101-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">MobileRead user forums</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The safest way to do this is by opening a File Explorer, then navigating to <em>This PC</em> and right-clicking on the Kobo.

Inside that folder, choose <em>Paste</em>. Wait for the file transfer to complete. Before moving on to the next step, spot check some files to verify the copy process was successful. (You can open EPUB files with a free program like <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://calibre-ebook.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1476101-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Calibre</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"step-5-create-a-screensaver-folder\">Step 5: Create a &ldquo;screensaver&rdquo; folder</h4>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Newly created screensaver folder on the Kobo Libra 2\" class=\"wp-image-1477266\" height=\"651\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kobo_screensaver_folder.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Open the folder named <code>.kobo</code>.

Minimizing all the inactive windows can feel like a chore, too, especially when already overwhelmed by the visual noise or delayed in getting to your desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t need to be. Just click on the title bar of your active window, hold your mouse button, and then give your mouse a little shake left and right. Everything else will instantly disappear, minimized to the Windows taskbar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need to pull up all your minimized windows later on? Simply repeat the same action again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s that easy, though in some versions of Windows 11, you may need to first toggle this feature on via <em>Settings &gt; Multitasking &gt; Title bar window shake</em>. The other caveat is that this feature won&rsquo;t restore windows that were individually minimized before shaking the active window.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Multitasking settings window\" class=\"wp-image-1486252\" height=\"738\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Titlebarshake.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>In Windows 11, you may first need to enable this feature before it&rsquo;ll work.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Long-time Windows veterans might recall this feature back from when it was still known as Aero Shake in Windows 7. If that&rsquo;s the case, you can build on your knowledge with a couple of other fun tricks, like memorizing the keyboard shortcut equivalent (<code>Win + Home</code>). Learning how to snap windows to the left or right half of your screen is also handy (<code>Win + Left Arrow</code> and <code>Win + Right Arrow</code>)&mdash;and you can supercharge your snapped windows by installing PowerToys and using <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/700812/you-should-be-using-fancyzones-microsofts-killer-multitasking-app.html\">FancyZones</a>, which lets you define custom sizes (and more than two zones) for snapped windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truth be told, the longer you use Windows, the harder it is to break old habits. (Full confession: I had clean forgotten this particular feature until an old colleague reminded me of it recently&mdash;I tend to hit <code>Win + Down Arrow</code> to immediately minimize a window when I&rsquo;m done with it.)

Three-plus PCI slot-thick designs seems to be the new standard for anything above the midrange. That&rsquo;s making it harder and harder to find a new, high-end card that can fit in those adorable mini-ITX PC builds. If you&rsquo;re breaking rulers in frustration, you might want to check out a new custom watercooling block that makes the RTX 4090 small enough to fit into a single slot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block was discovered by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://youtu.be/BZEfTVrhHs4&amp;xcust=2-3-1486422-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube channel Optimum Tech</a> (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/my-heart-is-aching-for-this-tiny-single-slot-rtx-4090/&amp;xcust=2-3-1486422-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PCGamer</a>) and featured in a recent video.

And on that note, not just any old RTX 4090 will do: this block is only compatible with a handful of cards from Inno3D, plus the reference design (<em>not </em>the Nvidia Founder&rsquo;s Edition). It&rsquo;s designed for enterprise applications, so it has no flashy RGB or other embellishments. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can find the right card, you still need a liquid cooling setup with a custom loop powerful enough to handle it while working with the rather small coolant line fittings. But if you&rsquo;re down for all that, installing the block probably won&rsquo;t phase you, and neither will the $166.36 part cost. Once everything is set up, the result is a card that&rsquo;s approximately one-quarter the volume of the stock RTX 4090 and ready to fit into pretty much any water-cooled PC. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimum Tech found that the water-cooled RTX 4090 didn&rsquo;t take any huge hit in thermal performance on his test bench. While you won&rsquo;t get the full cooling power that a larger setup can deliver, it&rsquo;s more than enough to run the latest games and make them look their best. And if you&rsquo;re trying to build a screaming fast gaming PC with the latest parts in a mini-ITX case, it might be your best option. </p>\n\nGraphics Cards</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1486465/get-one-of-our-favorite-ssds-for-ludicrously-cheap-2tb-for-120.html", "title": "Get one of our favorite SSDs for ludicrously cheap: 2TB for $120", "date_published": "2023-01-27 15:15:42+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Anytime you can get a mammoth 2TB SSD for $120, it&rsquo;s a deal.

A stone-cold PC market. A creative renaissance. An AI-powered future. Throughout all of this, Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface lineup has remained pretty much unchanged for years. Shouldn&rsquo;t Microsoft be doing something about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It likely is. That still doesn&rsquo;t excuse Microsoft leadership from recycling the same Surface devices, over and over and over. Microsoft originally launched the Surface to set new standards for the PC market. But lately it&rsquo;s looking more and more like other laptop manufacturers are blazing a trail, and Microsoft has left Surface linger behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft knows this. Its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1483172/microsoft-surface-sales-are-tanking-microsoft-says.html\">fourth-quarter earnings report detailed problems</a> launching Surface devices, and executives said that falling device sales would actually accelerate into this quarter. Meanwhile, chief executive Satya Nadella said that &ldquo;changes to our hardware portfolio&rdquo; would be coming in a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/18/subject-focusing-on-our-short-and-long-term-opportunity/&amp;xcust=2-1-1483197-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">layoff memo</a> he authored. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, Surface is stale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"cut-and-paste-hardware\">Cut-and-paste hardware</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s just begin with the simple truth: Microsoft has released five different Surface Laptops, about one per year since 2017. Place them next to one another, and you would be hard pressed to tell any of them apart. Ditto for the Surface Pro series, on its tenth iteration. Since the Surface Pro 3, they&rsquo;ve been virtually indistinguishable save for changes in ports and thickness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surface has always embraced something of a dichotomy. Throughout Surface&rsquo;s history, chief product officer Panos Panay &mdash; who helped introduce the Surface RT and Pro in 2012 &mdash; has always said that the Surface hardware is just a showcase for the operating system. &ldquo;The hardware fades to the background&hellip; so that the software can rise to the surface,&rdquo; Panay said at the original launch.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 \" class=\"wp-image-1484278\" height=\"887\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Surface-Laptop-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>You would be hard-pressed to tell which Surface Laptop this is. (In this case, it&rsquo;s the Surface Laptop 3.)</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the same time, Surface hardware has set out to lead the PC industry, not just exist within it. Just like the mouse was intrinsically tied to Windows, so too was Surface tied to Windows 8, explained Steve Ballmer, Microsoft&rsquo;s CEO at the time. Panay expanded upon Ballmer&rsquo;s original theme that the Surface was &ldquo;something new, something different,&rdquo; in a 2018 <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40530879/microsofts-panos-panay-on-surface-pros-first-five-years&amp;xcust=2-1-1483197-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">interview</a> with <em>Fast Company. </em> &ldquo;We built a business, and we have to grow that business,&rdquo; Panay said. &ldquo;And we are. Are we here to inspire? The answer&rsquo;s also yes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a similar dissonance between how Microsoft diversifies the Surface lineup, and how it develops subsequent products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft should be credited for taking risks &mdash; inspiring, maybe? &mdash; rival PC makers into trying out new form factors. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406333/microsoft-surface-studio-review-creativity-is-a-sublime-pricey-experience.html\">Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Studio lineup</a>, for example, received wide praise for its massive touch display, which made content creation <em>and</em> consumption an absolute joy. But the problem is that, once Microsoft establishes a product, it rarely refuses to improve upon it besides processor upgrades and other small changes. The thinking seems to be that each successful Surface is essentially a hole-in-one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just us. Compare recent reviews of Surface laptops or tablets from across the Internet, and a common theme emerges: Surfaces are kind of boring these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"competitors-are-leading-the-way\">Competitors are leading the way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not saying that Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t experiment. The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398356/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review.html\">Surface Pro X</a> survived two iterations before being pulled into the Surface Pro lineup as an always-connected version. We know that there was a canceled Surface Mini, and a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398154/microsofts-surface-neo-is-a-folding-pc-with-windows-10x-and-a-2020-ship-date.html\">Surface Neo</a>, and that Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/545199/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review.html\">updated the Surface Duo 2</a> to address its critics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But compare the Surface lineup to what we&rsquo;ve seen recently: the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444656/the-yogabook-9i-packs-a-radical-dual-screen-design.html\">Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</a>, a wacky book-like dual-screen laptop, or the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1428656/these-new-asus-laptops-may-have-the-best-display-youve-ever-seen.html\">Asus ProArt StudioBook 16</a>, with its wild 3D OLED display. History says that customers tend to be conservative on what they buy, so it&rsquo;s possible that the Yoga Book won&rsquo;t escape the fate of something like Acer&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/498962/acer_iconia.html\">dual-screen Iconia</a>, circa 2010. The Yoga Book is also very reminiscent of the Surface Neo, with its slide-over keyboard. We&rsquo;re willing to admit that Microsoft may have succeeded in inspiring even though it declined to bring a product to market. Still, it&rsquo;s the exception to the rule.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Yoga Book 9i\" class=\"wp-image-1448407\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lenovo-yoga-book-9i-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Lenovo&rsquo;s Yoga Book 9i may not succeed as well as a traditional clamshell notebook, but it feels fresh.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What we&rsquo;ve seen from rival laptop manufacturers, though, is that even small changes can translate into signature updates. Hearken back to 2016, and HP&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/415269/hp-spectre-133-laptop-review-thin-doesnt-have-to-mean-c\">Spectre was winning Editor&rsquo;s Choice awards</a> for thin lines and competitive performance. HP&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394081/hp-spectre-x360-14-review.html\">Spectre x360 (2021)</a> did as well, but with an abbreviated back corner that housed a Thunderbolt 4 port.

The &ldquo;Devices&rdquo; business includes the troubled HoloLens, which reports have already claimed <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/611416/report-microsoft-hololens-is-dead-as-its-mixed-reality-vision-implodes.html\">is dead</a>;, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/545199/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review.html\">rather iffy Surface Duo</a>; and the Xbox, which also suffered revenue declines. The Surface business undoubtedly makes up the bulk of Devices revenue, however it all shakes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the perfect storm that helped sink Microsoft&rsquo;s Devices business this quarter represents a perfect opportunity for Microsoft to reinvent the Surface: <em>not</em> make it larger (the Surface Hub), smaller (the Surface Go), cheaper (the Surface Laptop Go) or some variation on the theme. Instead, Microsoft has a chance to reinvigorate Surface entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What this means is that Microsoft is going to have to break from its theme of much of the past decade, productivity, and embrace what its Windows business is rediscovering: creativity.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Designer AI image art\" class=\"wp-image-1419224\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AI-image.png?w=1135\" width=\"1135\" /><figcaption>Microsoft Designer feels fresh like nothing else Microsoft has done in years.

They&rsquo;re <em>alive</em>, and pulse with a vibrancy that Microsoft&rsquo;s other apps lack. If Microsoft&rsquo;s mission for Surface is still to subsume itself in service to the software, then it&rsquo;s missing an opportunity. Step forward and embrace Microsoft&rsquo;s creative renaissance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start asking the questions: What can Microsoft do to empower creators that it hasn&rsquo;t done, to date? Is that tool the Surface Laptop Studio, the Surface Studio, or something else? Fans have been clamoring for a standalone Studio monitor for years. Is now the right time? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The largest question of all is one that Microsoft and many others may be brainstorming right now: <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1447856/ai-pcs-should-be-the-trend-that-begins-in-2023.html\">what does an AI-powered PC look like</a>? If Microsoft is inventing in OpenAI and retooling itself to empower all of its consumer and business apps with AI capabilities, what changes does that make to the hardware? Do we see Windows evolve into a translation platform between English and native code? One of the small notations Microsoft&rsquo;s Nadella made was to note that Microsoft&rsquo;s Power platform would gain AI capabilities, so that you&rsquo;ll be able to write apps by simply describing what they&rsquo;ll do. Does that imply a future where we dictate our own applications? Who knows?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that these are criticisms, not condemnations. At the launch of the Surface Pro 3, Panay addressed the haters. &ldquo;By the way, we&rsquo;ve read plenty of negative [coverage], and we learn and we take and we grow and we feed, and we get better,&rdquo; he said then. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;d expect nothing less. It all feels like Microsoft is on the cusp of&hellip;.something. What Microsoft and Panay will have to decide is, will Surface lead &mdash; or follow?</p>\n\nLaptops</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479939/i-got-tired-of-waiting-for-a-wireless-gaming-pc-keypad-so-i-made-my-own.html", "title": "I got tired of waiting for a wireless PC gaming keypad, so I made my own", "date_published": "2023-01-27 11:30:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When I built my first gaming PC, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/835679/we-need-more-left-hand-keypads-for-pc-gaming.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I plugged in a Belkin N52</a> instead of a gaming keyboard. Being weaned on the Genesis and playing almost nothing but console games since, I felt like I&rsquo;d be useless without some kind of thumbstick. Though I eventually got used to full WASD controls, I kept the dedicated left-hand keypad: I love the way it allows for a different feel for gaming input versus a keyboard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Razer bought the design from Belkin and turned it into the LED-adorned &ldquo;Nostromo,&rdquo; following that up with the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/447388/razer-tartarus-review-half-a-keyboard-for-the-exact-same-price.html\">Tartarus</a> and Orbweaver, and still sells a keypad that&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/gaming-keypads/razer-tartarus-pro&amp;xcust=2-1-1479939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">more or less the same 15 years later</a>. The Logitech G13, long since discontinued, was the only notable alternative at the time &mdash; the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.azeron.eu/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Azeron</a> is a newer spin on the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s missing, at least according to my &ldquo;battlestation&rdquo; sensibilities: wireless. My custom-made keyboard, mouse (also a Razer), and gaming headset are all wireless, but this one crucial component remains stubbornly tethered to a USB port.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Tartarus Pro keypad\" class=\"wp-image-1479954\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/razer-tartarus-pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Razer</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting for Razer or one of its competitors to make a wireless Tartarus for over a decade. At one point I even drilled a hole in my desktop just so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to look at that unsightly wire. But a few years ago I got tired of waiting, and I built one myself.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s how I did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m still begging Razer to make a wireless Tartarus (seriously, any Razer employees reading this, I&rsquo;m <em>literally begging you)</em>.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Built&rdquo; is perhaps a bit generous. I don&rsquo;t have the electronics knowledge to truly build an input gadget from scratch, especially one that&rsquo;s wireless. But after several years of assembling mechanical keyboards, I figured I had the tools and skills necessary to modify some kind of existing design into something that would suit me perfectly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step one was finding the base gadget. I needed something that roughly matched the one-handed design of the Tartarus. There are a few of these around, and more have become available since mobile gaming exploded. But finding one that was A) wireless and B) didn&rsquo;t use Bluetooth (because the latency isn&rsquo;t low enough for PC gaming) was a bit of a challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I settled on a goofy little pad from a smaller gaming accessory maker, the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HR8SGNF/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">GameSir VX</a>. This half-board-and-mouse combo is technically designed for consoles. The idea is that you plug the wireless dongle into a console, plug a controller into the secondary port, and the input is rerouted to the mouse and keyboard. (This is borderline cheating for multiplayer console games, especially shooters.) But the 2.4GHz dongle can plug into a PC just fine, and the mouse isn&rsquo;t necessary for it to function. I had a base. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Gamesir VX blue switches\" class=\"wp-image-1479970\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gamesir-switches.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"919\" /><figcaption><p>First order of business: Get rid of those slow, clicky Blue switches.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">GameSir</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The first modification was to replace the cheap, clickly switches. Like many off-brand gaming keyboards, the VX used the most common switches around, &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; clones from TTC, which are slow and tactile and not great for gaming. I disassembled the unit and exposed the PCB, then de-soldered all the switches and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WYVSJJD/?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1479939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">replaced them with Kailh BOX Dar</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WYVSJJD/?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1479939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">k</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WYVSJJD/?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1479939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Yellows</a>. These are linear switches, smooth and great for gaming, with a little extra stiffness that I prefer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"GameSir VX with custom yellow switches\" class=\"wp-image-1480066\" height=\"496\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/new-switches.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I disassembled the case anyway, I decided that the thing needed a more beefy battery. I <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TS8MCYC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1479939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ordered a 3000mAh LiPo battery</a> and a connector to match the existing one. This would give the gadget roughly triple its original battery life. Of course with a triple-sized battery I had to make some extra room inside the case. Not a problem: My trusty Dremel tool cut away some of the interior divisions of the plastic housing.&nbsp;I added a bit of foam to protect the battery from the pointy bits of the PCB. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Gamesir VX battery and Dremel tool\" class=\"wp-image-1480067\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/battery-and-dremel-tool.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Adding a larger battery required removing some of the plastic case with a Dremel tool.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With the switches replaced and the battery upgraded, the interior modifications were finished. I closed up the gadget, then added some big, premium keyboard feet on the right side. This gives it an extra half-inch or so of height on the right side, with a comfy ergonomic slant. The feet are also strongly magnetic, which will be useful later. (I honestly don&rsquo;t know where these feet came from &mdash; they&rsquo;re left over from one of many, many keyboard projects.) I <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F7Y1LRL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1479939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">added a wrist rest</a> with my favorite comfy cushion to replace the hard plastic one that comes with the GameSir VX. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Gamesir VX additional feet\" class=\"wp-image-1480069\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/feet.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>I added some beefy feet for a little ergonomic cant, and some bonus magnetic powers.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a mechanical keyboard nut, I wasn&rsquo;t in love with the aesthetics or feel of the cheap ABS keycaps that came with the VX. I replaced them with (also cheap, but much less so!) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://kprepublic.com/products/dsa-dolch-colorway-dsa-profile-dye-sub-keycap-set-pbt-plastic-for-keyboard-gh60-xd60-xd84-cospad-tada68-rs96-zz96-87-104-660?_pos=12&amp;_sid=3d073aa5e&amp;_ss=r&amp;xcust=2-1-1479939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PBT keycaps in a DSA profile from KPRepublic</a>. Fortunately the keys mostly match up on a standard keyboard. Note that the small space bar on the VX is a non-standard size &mdash; the long right Shift key from the keycap set is a suitable replacement, though it needed a bit of foam to stand in for the stabilizer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Gamesir VX with custom keycaps\" class=\"wp-image-1480070\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/keycaps.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Just for a bit of extra flair, I added <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08X485T3H?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1479939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">full steel keycaps for the WASD and Escape keys</a>. Not only are these a different material, they&rsquo;re a different height and profile from the surrounding keys, making them easy to distinguish without looking. As a final cosmetic touch, I took off the garish GameSir logo sticker and replaced it with a bit of hand-cut black vinyl instead. Bam, the project is finished.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now my custom, wireless mini-board with stiff, linear switches lives to the left of my main board, which uses soft but tactile switches for long typing sessions. The battery lasts for months at a time, and its 2.4GHz connection is fast and rock-solid. When I need a little extra space, the magnetic feet that give it a bit of a slant can be used to stick the device to my PC case to get it out of the way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Custom Gamesir VX on desk\" class=\"wp-image-1480071\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/on-the-desk.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The final product with wrist rest, sitting to the left of my main (typing) keyboard.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not a perfect solution. The GameSir VX lacks extras like a thumbstick or scroll wheel, and being designed mostly for consoles, the keys aren&rsquo;t reprogrammable. This isn&rsquo;t a big deal for gaming keyboards &mdash; more or less every PC game lets you rebind control keys. But I&rsquo;d love to be able to add easy media controls. And on the few occasions when I <em>do</em> need to recharge it, I have to dig out a MicroUSB cable. I&rsquo;d much rather it use USB-C.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Gamesir VX custom magnetically attached to PC.\" class=\"wp-image-1480072\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/stuck-to-PC.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>When not in use, I can use those magnetic feet to stick the keypad right on my PC under the desk.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But overall I&rsquo;m very pleased with the result, and I&rsquo;ve been using it for all my mouse-and-keyboard games for a couple of years now. I&rsquo;m still begging Razer to make a wireless Tartarus (seriously, any Razer employees reading this, I&rsquo;m <em>literally begging you), </em>but this will do in the meantime.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, if you <em>also </em>want a wireless left-hand keypad for PC gaming, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091B1PXV8/&amp;xcust=2-1-1479939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Redragon built one a while after I finished customizing the GameSir</a>.
