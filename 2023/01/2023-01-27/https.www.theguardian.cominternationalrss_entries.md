<p>Jacinda Ardern became a lightning rod for threats during the pandemic years, but has it changed New Zealand’s relatively civil political landscape forever?</p><p>Jacinda Ardern sat at a plastic table, laughing and chatting with primary school students as they unpacked their lunchboxes. “What’re your favourite lunches?” she asked the group, as they chewed through sliced quarters of orange.</p><p>It was a routine, bread-and-butter visit for the then-prime minister in February last year, checking on the progress of a government lunch program at a small school outside Christchurch. That afternoon, however, it quickly turned ugly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/28/abuse-death-threats-and-riots-new-zealand-reckons-with-a-toxic-political-discourse">Continue reading...</a>

## Jack van Poortvliet: ‘I’ve always had battles with myself. Now I manage it’

<p>Channelling his hatred of losing has helped Leicester’s scrum-half go from fourth choice at his academy to a rising star with England</p><p>Jack van Poortvliet was 15 when they told him he was not going to make it. Leicester’s age-group selectors felt there were bigger, better scrum-halves out there and, for a while, the farmer’s son from Norfolk was inconsolable. “It was everything to me and I was absolutely devastated. I remember the other boys at school trying to pick me up. I was so glum and shed a few tears. It was tough.”</p><p>So when you see Van Poortvliet, still only 21, running out for England in this year’s Six Nations championship do not make the mistake of thinking he was always the chosen one. The one destined to score a try on his England debut in Australia last summer. The one who could play international rugby for the next decade. The long-term heir apparent to one of his schoolboy local heroes, Ben Youngs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/27/jack-van-poortvliet-ive-always-had-battles-with-myself-now-i-manage-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A dozen acclaimed authors, including Val McDermid and Naomi Alderman,  create new mysteries for Agatha Christie’s detective to solve</p><p>When Agatha Christie created the amateur sleuth Miss Marple, a character inspired by her grandmother and her circle of friends, she said her intention was “to give old maids a voice”. Starting with the short story The Tuesday Night Club in 1927 and concluding with the posthumously published Sleeping Murder in 1976, the doughty detective from St Mary Mead would feature in 12 of Christie’s novels and 20 short stories.</p><p>In Marple: Twelve New Stories, a dozen fiction writers, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/val-mcdermid">Val McDermid</a>, Ruth Ware, Lucy Foley, Dreda Say Mitchell, Jean Kwok and Elly Griffiths, come up with new puzzles for Miss Marple to solve. Contributors were given strict criteria: they had to adhere to Christie’s period setting and not mess with the protagonist’s original backstory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/27/marple-twelve-new-stories-by-various-authors-audiobook-review-the-sleuth-reimagined">Continue reading...</a>

## Football transfer rumours: Chelsea and Newcastle circling Dumfries?

<p>Today’s fluff is feeling congested</p><p>Who are <strong>Chelsea</strong> linked with now, then? That’ll be the name of this column soon, the way things are going. <strong>Denzel Dumfries</strong>, the Internazionale right-back, is the latest transfer target to pop up on Todd Boehly’s radar, which is so effective that it has detected literally everything that moves for 5,000 miles around Stamford Bridge. There could be competition from <strong>Manchester United</strong> and <strong>Newcastle</strong>, however. According to <a href="https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Calciomercato/Inter/26-01-2023/inter-skriniar-dumfries-4502133411252.shtml">La Gazzetta dello Sport</a>, it will take an offer of at least €40m (£35.2m) to get negotiations under way.</p><p>Having won <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/20/rise-of-mykhaylo-mudryk-no-surprise-to-old-teammates-chelsea">the tug of war over Mykhailo Mudryk</a>, Chelsea could become embroiled in an arm-wrestle with <strong>Arsenal</strong> over <strong>Amadou Onana</strong>. The tittle-tattle in Belgium is that the Everton midfielder has already rejected the chance to move to the Boehly Bowl, giving Arsenal a possible advantage. Mikel Arteta has already conceded that, in light of Mohamed Elneny injuring his knee, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/25/mikel-arteta-admits-mohamed-elneny-injury-could-force-move-for-midfielder">he needs more cover</a> in the middle of the park. Onana would certainly be more affordable than <strong>Moisés Caicedo</strong>, whom Brighton now value at an eye-watering £100m. That figure rises daily.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/27/football-transfer-rumours-chelsea-and-newcastle-circling-dumfries">Continue reading...</a>

## Weather tracker: Cheneso restrengthens to bring flooding to Madagascar

<p>Tropical storm upgraded to cyclone status, hitting Indian Ocean island with 75mph winds and intense rainfall</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Madagascar continued to be hit by intense rainfall this week, resulting in serious flooding and several landslides. Severe Tropical Storm Cheneso made landfall in the north-east last week, and had weakened as it pushed south-west across the island. But after reaching the warm waters of the Mozambique channel on Monday, Cheneso restrengthened, achieving tropical cyclone status by Wednesday with sustained wind speeds of 75mph, equivalent to a category 1 hurricane.</p><p>Unusually, the system remained near-stationary for almost four days, stalling just off the west coast of Madagascar and bringing more than 100mm of rain each day to some coastal areas. Cheneso’s lack of movement resulted in weakening of the system on Thursday, as upwelling of cooler water beneath the storm reduced the energy available to the cyclone, and sustained winds decreased to about 55mph. The storm has now started to accelerate to the south, and begun the process of curving out towards the southern Indian Ocean. Cheneso may briefly restrengthen during this period, before becoming extratropical by Monday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/27/weather-tracker-cheneso-restrengthens-to-bring-flooding-to-madagascar">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(OVO)<br /></strong>Fiercely catchy choruses and slick vocals can’t disguise the fact that this album’s rags-to-riches story soon gets dull</p><p>Fifteen years into his career, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/28/popcaan-dance-hall-kingston">dancehall kingpin Andrae Sutherland, AKA Popcaan</a>, feels on top of the world. On his fifth album, Great Is He, he expresses gratitude for his rise with plenty of classic dancehall braggadocio – and who could blame him? From international collaborations with Gorillaz, Jamie xx and Pusha T, to selling out Wembley SSE arena in 2018, his distinctive singjaying has left an indelible mark on the culture.</p><p>Opening track Defeat the Struggle is a touching ode to ambition and upward mobility: “Ghetto yutes that have a dream,” he sings, “don’t ever let it go.” Then we’re thrown into the steel drums of Freshness, on which he boasts about “millions make one week”. The chorus of “Prada mi Prada, Gucci mi Gucci” is powerfully catchy, and across the album there are vividly evocative<strong> </strong>references to luxury goods that conjure imagery of fierce drip. His mentor, Vybz Kartel, showed off his Clarks; Popcaan shows off “fresh Louis V, fresh Nike Air”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/27/popcaan-great-is-he-review-ovo">Continue reading...</a>
