Charles here from Prequel (https://prequel.co). We just launched the ability to sync data from your own app/db/data warehouse to any of your customer\u2019s Google Sheets, CSV, or Excel \u2013 and I wanted to share a bit more about how we built the Google Sheets integration. If you\u2019re curious, see here for a quick GIF demo of our Google Sheets destination: https://storage.googleapis.com/hn_asset/Prequel_GoogleSheetsDemo.webp.<p>Quick background on us: we make it easy to integrate with and sync data to data warehouses. Problem is, there are plenty of folks who want access to their data, but don\u2019t have or don\u2019t know how to use a data warehouse. For example, FP&amp;A teams, customer success teams, etc.<p>To get around that, we added some non-db destinations to Prequel: Google Sheets, CSV, and Excel. We had to rework some core assumptions in order to get Google Sheets to work.<p>By default, Prequel does incremental syncs, meaning we only write net new or updated data to the destination. To avoid duplicate rows, we typically perform those writes as upserts \u2013 this is pretty trivial in most SQL dialects. But since Google Sheets is not actually a db, it doesn\u2019t have a concept of upserts, and we had to get creative.<p>We had two options: either force all Google Sheets syncs to be \u201cfull refreshes\u201d every time (eg grab all the data and brute-force write it to the sheet). The downside is, this can get expensive quickly for our customers, especially when data gets refreshed at higher frequencies (eg every 15 minutes).<p>The other, and better, option was to figure out how to perform upserts in Sheets. To do so, we read the data from the sheet we\u2019re about to write to into memory. We store it in a large map by primary key. We reconcile it with the data we\u2019re about to write. We then dump the contents of the map back to the sheet. In order to make the user experience smoother, we also sort the rows by timestamp before writing it back. This guarantees that we don\u2019t accidentally shuffle rows with every transfer, which might leave users feeling confused.<p>\u201cWait, you keep all the data in memory\u2026 so how do you avoid blowing up your pods?\u201d. Great question! Luckily, Google Sheets has pretty stringent cell / row size limits. This allows us to restrict the amount of data that can be written to these destinations (we throw a nice error if someone tries to sync too much data), and thereby also guarantees that we don\u2019t OOM our poor pods.<p>Another interesting problem we had to solve was auth: how do we let users give us access to their sheets in a way that both feels intuitive and upholds strong security guarantees? It seemed like the cleanest user experience was to ask the spreadsheet owner to share access with a new user \u2013 much like they would with any real human user. To make this possible without creating a superuser that would have access to _all_ the sheets, we had to programmatically generate a different user for each of our customers. We do this via the GCP IAM API, creating a new service account every time. We then auth into the sheet through this service account.<p>One last fun UX challenge to think through was how to prevent users from editing the \u201cgolden\u201d data we just sync\u2019d. It might not be immediately clear to them that this data is meant as a source of truth record, rather than a playground. To get around this, we create protected ranges and prevent them from editing the sheets we write to. Sheets even adds a little padlock icon to the relevant sheets, which helps convey the \u201cdon\u2019t mess with this\u201d.<p>If you want to take it for a spin, you can sign up on our site or reach us at hello (at) prequel.co.

I created Eightify to take my mind off things during a weekend, but I was surprised that my friends were genuinely interested in it. I kept going, and now it's been nine weeks since I started.<p>I got the idea to summarize videos when my friend sent me a lengthy video again. This happens to me often; the video title is so enticing, and then it turns out to be nothing. I had been working with GPT for 6 months by the time, so everything looked like a nail to me.<p>It's a Chrome extension, and I'm offering 5 free tries for videos under an hour. After that, you have to buy a package. I'm not making money yet, but it pays for GPT, which can be pricey for long texts. And some of Lex Fridman's podcasts are incredibly long.<p>I'm one of those overly optimistic people when it comes to GPT. So many people tell me, \"Oh, it doesn't solve this problem yet; let's wait for GPT-4\". The real issue is that their prompts are usually inadequate, and it takes you anywhere from two days to two weeks to make it work. Testing and debugging, preferably with automated tests. I believe you can solve many problems with GPT-3 already.<p>I would love to answer any questions you have about the product and GPT in general. I've invested at least 500 hours into prompt engineering. And I enjoy watching other people's prompts too!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34548154\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34548154</a></p>\n<p>Points: 30</p>\n<p># Comments: 19</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.awspuritytest.com/", "title": "AWS Purity Test", "date_published": "2023-01-27 16:40:30+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.awspuritytest.com/\">https://www.awspuritytest.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34548077\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34548077</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://mastodon.social/@alexjsp/109760277713815857", "title": "\u201cThey wanted my Instagram handle, and somehow they've now got it.\u201d", "date_published": "2023-01-27 16:23:22+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@alexjsp/109760277713815857\">https://mastodon.social/@alexjsp/109760277713815857</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34547773\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34547773</a></p>\n<p>Points: 32</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.screen-idle.com/classified-death-star-documents-discovered-in-darth-vaders-garage/", "title": "Classified Death Star documents discovered in Darth Vader\u2019s garage", "date_published": "2023-01-27 16:17:19+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.screen-idle.com/classified-death-star-documents-discovered-in-darth-vaders-garage/\">https://www.screen-idle.com/classified-death-star-documents-discovered-in-darth-vaders-garage/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34547687\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34547687</a></p>\n<p>Points: 20</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-16/", "title": "Godot 4.0 beta 16: Initial .NET 7 support", "date_published": "2023-01-27 16:13:48+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-16/\">https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-16/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34547637\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34547637</a></p>\n<p>Points: 49</p>\n<p># Comments: 18</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://kidger.site/thoughts/just-know-stuff/", "title": "Just know stuff.

Maybe the community just needs to hear about what you're offering, what you've been working on.

The company is based in EU and EUR has been chosen as settling currency. I am therefore looking for an EU-base bank with good API to automate the necessary processes. So far, local banks are very bad in this regard. I looked at Wise and Revolut but they won't give me access to the sandbox environment to test and evaluate their APIs without signing up for paid business plan straight away, which is simply a no-go. Can you therefore recommend a bank with good API? By good I mean that it at least has a concept of idempotency and nonce and webhooks. I really don't need that much but the state of things is rotten.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34543832\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34543832</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://pashword.app", "title": "Show HN: Pashword \u2013 Hashed Password Calculator", "date_published": "2023-01-27 07:55:55+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://pashword.app\">https://pashword.app</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34543700\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34543700</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DeepFakesSFW/comments/10meypl/deepfaked_tom_cruise_and_paris_hilton_what_do_you/", "title": "Deepfaked Tom Cruise and Paris Hilton", "date_published": "2023-01-27 07:21:02+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/DeepFakesSFW/comments/10meypl/deepfaked_tom_cruise_and_paris_hilton_what_do_you/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/DeepFakesSFW/comments/10meypl/deepfaked_tom_cruise_and_paris_hilton_what_do_you/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34543521\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34543521</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2023/01/26/computers-enable-fantasies-on-the-continued-relevance-of-weizenbaums-warnings/", "title": "\u201cComputers enable fantasies\u201d \u2013 the continued relevance of Weizenbaum\u2019s warnings", "date_published": "2023-01-27 07:20:55+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2023/01/26/computers-enable-fantasies-on-the-continued-relevance-of-weizenbaums-warnings/\">https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2023/01/26/computers-enable-fantasies-on-the-continued-relevance-of-weizenbaums-warnings/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34543518\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34543518</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/enso/jobs/yON8exA-senior-typescript-developer", "title": "Enso (YC S21) Is Hiring TypeScript Developer", "date_published": "2023-01-27 07:00:18+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/enso/jobs/yON8exA-senior-typescript-developer\">https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/enso/jobs/yON8exA-senior-typescript-developer</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34543419\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34543419</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://github.com/ea/lytro_unlock", "title": "Lytro Unlock \u2013 Making a bad camera slightly better", "date_published": "2023-01-27 05:48:52+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/ea/lytro_unlock\">https://github.com/ea/lytro_unlock</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34542993\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34542993</a></p>\n<p>Points: 32</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34542824", "title": "Ask HN: Right to Repair for Software?", "date_published": "2023-01-27 05:26:33+00:00", "description": "<p>How would you implement a right to repair for software in 2023?<p>Perhaps you could change copyright law to require either public source code or source code escrow before software could be eligible for copyright protection.
