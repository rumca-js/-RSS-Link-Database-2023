The man, in his mid-to late-50s, wants it to be known that everyone will be “having a party when Sol Campbell dies”. The platform is not particularly crowded and nobody else joins in. Equally, no one steps in. The train arrives, the man gets on and goes home.</p><p>In the seconds before kick-off, there had been a different chant from the Spurs support in the South Stand.

The club can only pray that the next manager’s roadmap for Premier League survival brings more clarity and success than their own.</p><p>Dyche was close to being appointed as the eighth permanent manager of the chaotic Farhad Moshiri era on Friday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/26/marcelo-bielsa-arrives-england-everton-farhad-moshiri-manager">after talks with Bielsa</a>, the first choice, ended without agreement on Thursday. From high-tempo, attacking, possession-based football under the Argentinian to the more direct, defensively sound and pragmatic approach of the former Burnley manager inside 24 hours. You can see where the protestor with the “no plan, no vision” banner at Goodison Park is coming from.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/27/everton-must-pray-arrival-of-sean-dyche-can-provide-more-clarity-than-their-own-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> Raven Jackson’s gorgeous, sparsely worded debut film evokes the non-linear memories of one Black woman in Mississippi</p><p>There will be a moment in All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt, the gorgeous, unconventional debut from Raven Jackson, when the film’s spell works. It may be in the first 15 minutes, lulled by Mississippi’s lush soundscape and meditative shots of a Southern summer, or an extended take in a hospital delivery room. It could wait until the final scene, an ode to memories already recorded and yet to come.</p><p>The pull of this sparsely worded, deeply sensitive film will likely depend on what triggers one’s personal sentimentality and, more pertinently, how much you know about it going in. The plot is so loosely outlined, and the camera so frequently turned to hands over faces, that it could be difficult, sans context, to pick up on its ambitious logic: a series of non-chronological memories in the life of one Black woman, connected by the senses of touch and sound and particularly attuned to the lingering feel of one’s skin on another.</p><p>All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt premiered at the Sundance film festival and will be released later this year</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/27/all-dirt-roads-taste-of-salt-movie-review-sundance-film-festival-raven-jackson">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Dr David Bell</strong>, former staff governor at the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust, on its Gender Identity Development Service</p><p>When considering the interim report by Dr Hilary Cass on gender identity services for children and young people, your article overemphasises the long waiting list and underemphasises that it was a waiting list for the <em>wrong treatment</em>, as Cass makes clear (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/19/a-contentious-place-the-inside-story-of-tavistocks-nhs-gender-identity-clinic">‘A contentious place’: the inside story of Tavistock’s NHS gender identity clinic, 19 January</a>).</p><p>A clinician you quote says some staff left the Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) “in a destructive way”. They did not – they raised serious concerns with their managers which resulted in their intimidation. These concerns were borne out by the Cass review – particularly that as a result of the ideological penetration of Gids, it abandoned clinical neutrality and downplayed the significance of other serious conditions in this patient group. The Cass report makes clear that these children have been disadvantaged and that there is a lack of evidence for the “Dutch Approach” to treating them, involving puberty blockers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/27/gender-identity-treatment-needs-greater-caution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rapper Yung Gravy’s hit Betty (Get Money) made authorised use of Never Gonna Give You Up’s melody, but lawsuit argues vocal ‘imitation’ was unacceptable</p><p>Is it possible for a rickroll to go too far? Twenty-six-year-old rapper Yung Gravy may be about to find out. Born Matthew Hauri, the musician – from Rochester, Minnesota – had a viral hit last year with Betty (Get Money), a track that heavily interpolated Rick Astley’s 1987 hit Never Gonna Give You Up – which itself gained new prominence 20 years after its initial release thanks to rickrolling, a phenomenon in which internet users troll each other by sending covert links to the song’s music video. Now, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/rick-astley-yung-gravy-lawsuit-never-gonna-soundalike/">Billboard reports</a> that Astley is suing Gravy, saying that the rapper violated his “right of publicity” by hiring a singer to imitate his voice on the track.</p><p>Although Gravy’s use of the melody and lyrics of Never Gonna Give You Up was authorised by Astley, his lawsuit claims that he never authorised Gravy and his collaborator, Nick Seeley, to use his “signature voice” on the song. The lawsuit suggests that Gravy “conspired to include a deliberate and nearly indistinguishable imitation of Mr Astley’s voice”, with the intent to “capitalise off of the immense popularity and goodwill” of Astley. Astley’s lawyers claim that Gravy’s song caused “immense damage”, given that Astley is “extremely protective” over his image and likeness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/27/yung-gravy-sued-by-rick-astley-signature-voice-betty-get-money-never-gonna-give-you-up">Continue reading...</a>

## Hertha and Union Berlin meet as two clubs on seemingly opposite paths

<p>Hertha have long been considered the biggest club in the city but their struggles have coincided with Union’s surprise surge from the lower leagues to second place in the Bundesliga</p><p>There was a time, of course, when this was not really a rivalry at all. For most of the last century Hertha Berlin and Union Berlin existed in separate worlds: divided by geography and history, by the 23 kilometres from the Olympiastadion in Charlottenburg to the Alte Försterei in Köpenick, by several league divisions and – famously – a large wall. To this day there are Union fans who say their biggest adversaries are not Hertha but their east Berlin neighbours Dynamo, and heartily continue to sing anti-Dynamo songs on their way to games.</p><p>Indeed, during the cold war a curious solidarity existed between the two clubs. Hertha fans from the west would cross into east Berlin to watch Union games. Union fans would make trips to Prague and Plovdiv to watch Hertha in European competition. In January 1990, a couple of months after the fall of the Wall, the clubs played an emotional friendly in front of 50,000 fans at the Olympiastadion. There were tears in the stands and embraces on the pitch. Briefly, Hertha and Union seemed to capture the indomitable spirit of the reunified city.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/27/hertha-and-union-berlin-meet-as-two-clubs-on-seemingly-opposite-paths">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Truss to Johnson, former chaos-mongers are sure none of it is remotely their fault. In fact, the time is ripe for a comeback</p><p>It’s encouraging to see Liz Truss hoving back into view, after a period in the wilderness only slightly longer than that endured by the OG messiah. And, indeed, only slightly longer than her entire premiership. As one ally <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/21217971-a3c0-4d9a-946e-f6a5ee39d8b5">told the Financial Times</a> of her abortive adventures in the public finances this week: “Liz believes that the policy was right but she didn’t get the political backing she needed.” Erm. Does that quite cover it? Having failed to get backing from her colleagues, the markets, business, the Bank of England, the public and experts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and beyond, Liz was arguably a full six <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Stones">infinity stones</a> short of a gauntlet.</p><p>Still, it feels inevitable that another betrayal narrative should be cranking up. You can never have too many, can you? Having accidentally divested itself of various of its other manufacturing industries, the UK is now world-beating in producing betrayal narratives, with supporters of any number of the politicians who played a part in the rolling chaos of the past seven years still claiming that their standard bearer was falsely victimised by people who simply lacked their vision. British politics throws the best pity parties.

It <em>is</em> much more forgiving than traditional yeasted doughs, and comes together in a fraction of the time. But there are other reasons to make it. Quite simply, it is a delicious, homely bread that I think everyone should have in their repertoire. I’ve taken this version over to the sweet side, but it still holds on to the original’s rustic charm.

What happens to the people who share the terrifying experience of being surrounded by walls of flame? How do families cope when everything they own is incinerated? The startlingly awful new fantasy drama Wolf Pack (Paramount+) asks a bigger, deeper question. You see that big fire? Well, what if there was a werewolf in it?</p><p>After a fleeting introductory scene in which a park ranger sees a fire, stops his vehicle, gets out and stands square-chested in the road, looking with grizzled apprehension at the flames, we are aboard a yellow school bus in Los Angeles. It should be taking Everett (Armani Jackson) to his classes but is snarled in traffic, with the wildfire raging in the Angeles National Forest not 50 yards away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/27/wolf-pack-review-sarah-michelle-gellar-tv-comeback-is-mind-bendingly-bad">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London</strong><br />Coleridge-Taylor’s stately, long-lost Solemn Prelude and a crisp, exploratory interpretation of Elgar’s first symphony completed a trio of English compositions</p><p>Three very English but three very different composers – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/14/lenry-henry-classical-music-samuel-coleridge-taylor-black-british-classical-composer-stereotypes">Samuel Coleridge-Taylor</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/sep/23/michael-tippett-the-midsummer-marriage-edward-gardner">Michael Tippett</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/edward-elgar">Edward Elgar</a> – made up the London Philharmonic’s latest programme under Edward Gardner. The centrepiece was unquestionable: a rare but thoroughly persuasive outing for Tippett’s fluent yet entangled piano concerto of 1953-55.</p><p>It was condemned as unplayable by the soloist Julius Katchen, who walked out shortly before he was due to give the premiere. These days, especially in the hands of Steven Osborne, <a href="https://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dw.asp?dc=W10634_67461">a champion</a> of the work, that seems an extraordinary misjudgment about a concerto that has proved its staying power.

It would be hard to imagine a more convincing account than the one that, playing from the score, he conjured here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/27/classical-lpo-gardner-review-royal-festival-hall-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The photo-sharing app leads to some pretty random images – and with them unexpected but useful style lessons</p><p>The social media platform BeReal, in which users take a photo during a random two-minute period every day, is not an obvious place to look for style inspiration. Unlike Instagram, which is full of selfies taken specifically to show off a new coat, a good hair day or a flattering lift mirror, BeReal shows everyone at their most humdrum. If Instagram is a glossy, coffee table book compilation of high days and holidays, Be Real is a blooper reel of life’s tea-bath-bed days.</p><p>If you are on the app, you get a notification to take a picture of what you are doing at a random time of day – and the reverse camera snaps a selfie while you are doing it. It means you are much more likely to be in the park in your dog-walking coat or sitting at your laptop in an old hoodie than you are to be dolled up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/27/what-bereal-selfies-have-taught-me-about-my-fashion-choices">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Try expressing your concerns more directly – but the pandemic may have been an excuse to change the way he lives</p><p><strong>I am worried about my brother and wondering if there is any way to help him through his </strong><strong>fear of Covid. It’s prevented him going out for all but essential errands and appointments since the beginning of the pandemic (neither he nor his wife go out to work). At the root of it is a very understandable concern about infecting his wife, who has some underlying health conditions. But</strong><strong> they </strong><strong>were happy to socialise for many years before Covid – the risk of catching coughs/colds</strong><strong> etc</strong><strong> was not a major concern (they’re both healthy in other ways). Sadly the </strong><strong>lockdowns seem to have triggered a general paranoia about germs, infection and mingling with other people. This is despite also being fully vaccinated and boosted</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>I’ve gently tried to coax him into socialising in a safe setting – </strong><strong>at the park with just me and my wife</strong><strong>, getting a coffee </strong><strong>outside, </strong><strong>and offering to do LFTs in advance for extra reassurance</strong><strong> – but he’s still anxious about face-to-face contact </strong><strong>and declines. My worry too is that he and his wife are subconsciously feeding each other’s fears – made especially intense with them </strong><strong>being at home all day – and that they can’t get themselves out of this way of thinking and behaving.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/27/my-brothers-fear-of-covid-has-stopped-him-socialising-how-can-i-help-him">Continue reading...</a>

## OAE/Emelyanychev review – Camille Saint-Saëns interpreted with tautness and clarity

<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London</strong><br />Emelyanychev sheds fresh light on the familiar, while superb solos culminate with an extraordinarily moving performance that seems to make time stand still </p><p>Saint-Saëns is among the most paradoxical of composers. A classicist and self-styled eclectic, he nevertheless drew on the musical language of the Romantic era in which he lived, but eccentrically insisted that personal emotion should ideally play no part in composition, a curious stance that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/02/saint-saens-proms-unfashionable-underrated-and-overdue-for-reappraisal">his own work</a> predictably more than once contradicts. Gabriel Fauré once described him as “the most complete musician we have ever possessed,” though others, notably Debussy, disparaged him as conservative and had doubts about his worth. After his death, aged 86, in 1921, his reputation fluctuated wildly, and much of his colossal output remains in limbo. <a href="https://www.veroniquejourdain.com/en/maxim-emelyanychev/">Maxim Emelyanychev</a> and the <a href="https://oae.co.uk/">Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment</a>’s concert of his music, however, was a reminder of just how wonderful he can be.</p><p>Throughout, Emelyanychev shed fresh light on much that is familiar. Most interpreters think of the Organ Symphony (No 3) as being about decibels and immensity, where Emelyanychev views it in terms of tautness and clarity. This is not to say that the ending didn’t raise the roof (James McVinnie was the excellent organist), but the lean sound of period instruments confers transparency on music that can often seem over-plush. And what was so remarkable here was the level of detail, with every note and shift in texture hitting home, from the whirring strings of the first movement’s allegro to the complex brass writing in the ceremonial finale. Emelyanychev’s way with the symphony’s structural logic, keenly exposing the cut and thrust of its musical argument, was immaculate too.</p><p>To be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 28 March</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/27/oae-emelyanychev-review-royal-festival-hall-london">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Do I like interviews? No’: fighting for words with the evasive Artur Beterbiev

<p>The Russian fighter, who faces Anthony Yarde on Saturday, prefers to keep his life a mystery and is a master at saying nothing</p><p>“Do you like interviews?” I ask the most coldly ferocious puncher in professional boxing. Artur Beterbiev, the only world champion boxer to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/19/artur-beterbiev-joe-smith-jr-fight">won every single one of his professional fights by knockout</a>, looks quietly at me as he weighs up his response to my exasperated and mildly sarcastic question. The 38-year-old Russian, who holds the IBF, WBC and WBO world light-heavyweight titles, strokes his beard and then gives me a blunt answer: “No.”</p><p>I wish I could say that I have spent the previous 20 minutes going toe-to-toe with the formidable Beterbiev, probing him with questions that persuade him to open up and discuss his mysterious aura, <a href="https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/646981">terrifying knockout record</a>, Islamic faith and seemingly close relationship with the Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov. But he responds to most queries with amused evasion. It’s another mismatch because Beterbiev is a master at saying nothing and our hapless interview is reeling already.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/27/do-i-like-interviews-no-fighting-for-words-with-the-evasive-artur-beterbiev">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The N64 shooter was one of the most innovative games in history – and the myths around its creation still intrigue</p><p>Life moves pretty slow on a video game magazine when the last pages are being sent to the printer. As a writer on Edge, I’d have to be available in the office to write captions and headlines, but often we were there long into the night as the art team designed pages. So the writers and subs would have nothing to do but wait and play games. And for many months, the game we played was GoldenEye.</p><p>Released two years after the film, into a market where tie-ins were never exactly epoch-making products, it’s fair to say expectations were low for the N64 shooter. But this was a shooter by Rare, the veteran Midlands-based developer of Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct, and the game that would introduce a lot of players to the concept of using an analogue stick to look around in a 3D game – it’s difficult to overstate how important that was.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/27/goldeneye-007-classic-n64">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘This is confident, swaggering cooking. You’ll get fed until you can barely walk’</p><p>One of the several million reasons I love Great Britain, and can never truly join in with giving it a kicking, is our place names. Nobody doles them out like we do. Take Slad in the Cotswolds. Yes, it’s a charming village on the side of a valley, but it has the name of a Brutalist architect or a 15th-century Romanian warlord. Just the word Slad evokes arduous winters and that bit in An American Werewolf in London when the doomed walkers drop in at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07FdVcspOfQ">the terrifying local pub on darts night</a>.</p><p>But Slad, in fact, has a very welcoming pub called <a href="https://www.thewoolpackslad.com/">the Woolpack</a>, which several folk have mentioned to me over the years, although I’ve eschewed it because people always recommend their local, plus how many of them really want to see a restaurant reviewer in there? The Woolpack, however, has coped with far more celebrated writers than me. For one thing, this used to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/laurie-lee">Laurie Lee</a>’s local, and he didn’t just describe salad; he wrote the much-adored <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jul/08/cider-with-rosie-laurie-lee-horror-darkness">Cider With Rosie</a>, which has sold more than six million copies and haunted many a school syllabus. A Slad resident until his death in 1997, Lee was often seen at The Woolpack, which still has about it a literary feel, and even has its own minuscule bookshop. It is little more than a shelf really, but it’s still charming, because, in most other ways, this 300-year-old watering hole is decidedly higgledy-piggledy and has outside toilets down a set of stone stairs – back in chilly January, when I went to spend a penny there, I quietly thanked whoever had turned on the radiator.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/27/the-woolpack-slad-gloucestershire-fancy-but-hearty-food-restaurant-review">Continue reading...</a>

Is it really a good idea to expand the world of the geeky cult classic 1982 original into a macro-universe of shiny digital pixels? Well, that one has an answer: no it isn’t, or Tron: Legacy would have been a lot more noteworthy.

<p>Revelations over Tory party chair’s tax affairs come as the Doomsday Clock moves closer to midnight</p><p><strong>Monday</strong></p><p>Rishi the recidivist. To add to his fixed-penalty notice for joining Boris Johnson at his birthday party during lockdown, the prime minister has now clocked up a second for not wearing a seatbelt. Not the worst crime, but one of the dumbest. Sunak only got caught because he filmed himself breaking the law. Not sure Rishi is cut out for life as a career criminal. Even so, he appears to be rather more trustworthy than some of his colleagues. A low bar, admittedly. First there is Boris Johnson who didn’t appear to think there was anything questionable about asking an old mucker, Richard Sharp, to secure a loan facility before then recommending him to be chairman of the BBC. And what is it with Boris that he needs £800K to maintain his lifestyle when he already has friends paying for his accommodation? You can tell Johnson knows he’s done something wrong because he sloped off to Ukraine to see Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the weekend. Then there’s Nadhim Zahawi, the Tory party chair, who appears to have accidentally failed to fill in his tax return correctly, threatened journalists who wanted to reveal the story and negotiated his own settlement with HMRC when he was … chancellor. He now can’t even remember how much of the £4m or so he forked out was a penalty and says any irregularity was “carelessness”. Weird that the very rich never carelessly pay too much tax. Zahawi wants to stay on but my bet is he is on borrowed time. Gone by the end of the month. So much for Sunak’s promise of a Tory party guided by “professionalism, integrity and accountability”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/27/digested-week-zahawi-is-on-borrowed-time-though-arent-we-all">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, Cardiff</strong><br />There was rich variety to this programme of settings of ancient Chinese poetry by 15 composers, from Peter Warlock’s ‘whispering farewell’ to Pavel Haas’s tender lament</p><p>Mahler’s settings of translations of ancient Chinese verses in his symphony Das Lied von der Erde are probably the best known of their kind, but he was not alone in being seduced by the poetry of the Tang Dynasty. For this recital, marking the beginning of the Chinese new year, the bass-baritone Shenyang assembled songs by 15 composers (a sequence slightly extended in their Wigmore Hall appearance on the weekend). By no means all familiar, these were mainly 20th-century names, though sometimes more 19th-century Romantic in style. </p><p>Entitling the programme Variations of Jade – the stone whose name means pure, explained Shenyang – it was both the variety of style and the variations in the richly expressive detail Shenyang brought to his interpretations that made for compelling listening.

## Fern Maddie review – tender and powerful performance of ballads old and new

<p><strong>Cafe #9, Sheffield<br /></strong>The folk musician strips her music back to the bones, amplifying the emotional intensity in a cosy firelit space</p><p>‘This place is magical,” says Fern Maddie. She’s explaining that she just randomly met an audience member, who was about 50 and went to the same “weird hippy college” as her in her home state of Vermont. Maddie only recently took a break from living in the woods and tending goats there to play her first tour – only to bump into someone with mutual friends more than 3,000 miles away.</p><p>You suspect the occasion was ordained by the folk musician’s acclaimed 2022 album <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/01/fern-maddie-ghost-story-review-folk-album">Ghost Story</a>, which she self-released, but found widespread acclaim beyond Vermont. Touring in support of the record, Maddie plays a mix of old and new songs, and opens with a run of traditionals: Cumberland Gap and Don’t You Go a Rushing. Beginning on guitar, her playing is understated, but as she switches to banjo it becomes more expressive and detailed, striking a deft balance between technical proficiency and eloquent fluidity. Her voice has the ability to soar but is contained and never bombastic; it occasionally recalls the delivery of Joanna Newsom, but with less of a sharp edge. Most often, it sounds tender and powerful at once. Despite a profound love of traditional ballads, Maddie’s own compositions, such as Northlands and the stirring Dorothy May, are often the most arresting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/27/fern-maddie-review-tender-and-powerful-performance-of-ballads-old-and-new">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Game Freak/Apple; iPhone<br /></strong>The cult 3DS game has been refreshed for smartphones and the combination of card game and horse racing is as weird and addictive as ever </p><p>Ten years ago, Pokémon programmer Masao Taya had the idea of combining a solitaire card game with a horse-racing sim and somehow, instead of sending him home to bed, developer Game Freak let him make it. The result was Pocket Card Jockey on the Nintendo 3DS and its cult success has now led to a new smartphone version, which takes the weird concept and quite literally gallops with it.</p><p>You play as an aspiring jockey, looking to work your way up through the ranks by competing in a series of progressively more challenging races. To win, you need to be successful in a series of solitaire rounds (using the simple Golf variation of the game), clearing the screen by matching sequences of cards. The closer you get to a completely clean slate, the more energy your horse gets for the next few furlongs of the race. You also need to manage their position in the pack, using a resource named Unity to guide them between opponents or to get them nearer the inside edge when going round a corner. It’s also important to conserve stamina for the final stretch where you get direct control over your ride, using a whip to boost their run as you gallop for the finishing line.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/27/pocket-card-jockey-ride-on-review-saddle-up-for-eccentricity">Continue reading...</a>

The actor is back with another contribution to the Netflix canon, this one an unfortunate monument to the unexamined life.</p><p>Hill stars in, co-produced and co-wrote You People with Black-ish creator Kenya Barris. Strong as its streetwear and soundtrack game may be, the project lacks the discipline or specificity that makes a romantic comedy pop. Instead we have an updated yet out-of-date revisit of Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner by way of Meet The Parents. A nice Jewish boy and a nice Black girl like each other. A lot. And there’s the premise for the screenplay, a smorgasbord of time-killing and wannabe edgy jokes that dives headstrong into stereotypes. The whole enterprise strains to milk a relatively NBD situation for all the WTF it can.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/27/you-people-movie-review-netflix-jonah-hill-eddie-murphy-julia-louis-dreyfus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Baywatch star comes across as a very likable personality in this elusive documentary that casts its eyes over her past life, sex tape and all</p><p>Gentle, friendly, faintly bleary – and sans makeup – Pamela Anderson is an authentically likable screen presence in this intimate, if somehow elusive, documentary portrait from Ryan White; it is about her life and times and the super-strength misogyny she has faced from liberals and satirists in the long endgame of her celebrity career. (This, incidentally, is yet another documentary which shows how very badly talkshow monologues can date.)</p><p>Anderson is interviewed at her lakeside property in Canada, musing wryly and shrewdly about the media, often hanging out on camera with her two grownup sons who are fiercely fond and protective. The movie uses her sweetly innocent diaries (from which Pamela reads softly) and her home videos with badass ex-husband Tommy Lee, from which the notorious sex tape was pirated and sold, helping to fuel the world wide web in its early dial-up era.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/27/pamela-a-love-story-review-pamela-anderson-looks-back-baywatch-sex-tape">Continue reading...</a>

## Last Tango in Paris at 50: Bertolucci’s controversial drama remains troubling

<p>The Italian director’s knotty drama remains a provocation, a film filled with lyrical beauty but also repulsive cruelty</p><p>Revisiting films on the occasion of major anniversaries can be a disorienting reminder of time’s too-swift passage: <em>that </em>film is now 20/30/40 years old? How can that be? Why does it still feel so much younger than I do? In other cases, however, the film wears its advanced age in a way that makes complete sense, and so it is with Last Tango in Paris, released in cinemas in 1973. Now a half-century old, Bernardo Bertolucci’s lightning rod for scandal and debate has dated in many of the ways you might expect, but that’s not quite what I mean: at 50, the film’s age has now caught up with the overriding air of middle-aged despair and disarray that it always carried. In a sense, it was a film made to be forgotten, and then remembered with bittersweet, conflicted feelings, its significant beauty curdled over time.</p><p>Bring up Last Tango in Paris in cinephile circles today – especially those reckoning with the gender politics of the artform post-MeToo – and you won’t hear that many fond endorsements. When it’s brought up at all, the conversation swiftly narrows to its most notorious scene: the one where Marlon Brando’s Paul, a recently widowed American abroad, holed up in a desolately furnished Parisian apartment, forces himself on Maria Schneider’s Jeanne, a 20-year-old ingenue whose name he refuses to learn. Grabbing a dab of fridge-cold butter for lubrication, he anally rapes her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/27/last-tango-in-paris-bertolucci-anniversary">Continue reading...</a>

## Salute Madonna: defying the odds at 64. But what are the work choices for other women her age? | Gaby Hinsliff

<p>The government could have seriously improved women’s prospects with menopause protections this week. It bottled it</p><p>The most shocking thing Madonna has ever done, as she once said herself, is just to keep on publicly being Madonna. She won’t give up. She won’t fade away. She won’t be shamed, at the age of 64, into retirement; she is still jumping on every TikTok trend, still pumping out sexually suggestive clips to promote her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/17/madonna-announces-celebration-greatest-hits-world-tour">upcoming world tour</a>.</p><p>And if there’s something faintly spooky now about the tautness of her face, then she is arguably doing what she has to do to remain relevant and marketable inside an industry that holds women to impossible standards. Admittedly, it all looks faintly exhausting. But the pressure to keep on keeping on at whatever we do, in the teeth of ageist assumptions, is coming for us all soon enough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/27/madonna-64-work-choices-other-women-menopause-protections">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We didn’t attract enough customers and it slowly dawned on me that the publican is not the customer – it was me who had to eject unruly patrons and make tough decisions</p><p>My accountant once gave me two pieces of business advice: don’t run anything with your family and don’t run a pub. So I decided to run a pub with my family. I had always loved pubs, even before I was old enough to drink. I earned my first money in them, as a very bad pianist, and found them friendly, sociable and very relaxed about my blindness. They are also, incidentally, great places to navigate if you can’t see, as you can steer yourself by sound: fruit and games machines whirring; a busy till; the frothing of pints being pulled; old Roger pontificating from his usual seat. For decades, I’d found them great places to make and meet friends, develop ideas and unwind and I began to harbour the ambition to run a pub myself one day. </p><p>So when the owners of a pub I often frequented invited me to go in with them on the lease of another, I didn’t hesitate. My children had all gravitated towards the hospitality trade and it seemed like the perfect family venture.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/27/the-one-change-that-didnt-work-running-a-pub-left-me-desperate-for-a-night-in">Continue reading...</a>

## Why accusing Harry Styles and Cardi B of queerbaiting is regressive

<p>The term once addressed real fears – but it has become a means of policing identity as it ‘reduces sexuality to a tick box’</p><p>In November, following weeks of comments on social media targeting Kit Connor over his playing a queer character in Netflix’s LGBTQ+ coming-of-age drama Heartstopper, the actor tweeted a short, exasperated response: “I’m bi,” he wrote. “Congrats for forcing an 18-year-old to out himself. I think some of you missed the point of the show.”</p><p>Connor’s statement sparked another reckoning over the idea of queerbaiting, a term that has been in use since the early 2000s. Changing social media and celebrity culture has fueled a renewed interest in the concept, which originated as a criticism of books and films that hinted at a character’s queerness without explicitly confirming it. But it’s since expanded to encompass a broader critique of people who appropriate queer culture without publicly identifying as LGBTQ+.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/26/queerbaiting-accusations-harry-styles-cardi-b-taylor-swift">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Oscar winner on learning from his mistakes, his latest role as a serial killer nurse – and why he’s not wearing a wedding ring</p><p>Drinking coffee in the restaurant of a central London hotel as jazz burbles away in the background, Eddie Redmayne is wearing faded blue jeans, a white sweatshirt and a scarf. No wedding band, though. Uh-oh. “‘Spotted without his ring!’” he says, mock-horrified. He misplaced it while shooting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/31/the-danish-girl-review-redmayne-tom-hooper">The Danish Girl</a> eight years ago, which is only one of the reasons to lament that film. We’ll get to the others in good time.</p><p>He bought a replacement ring then lost that, too, so he gave up. On jewellery, that is, not marriage. “I am incredibly happily married so I’m afraid there’s no scoop there,” he says apologetically. The tone fits with his demeanour, which is that of a Saturday boy at John Lewis: posh, affable, sincerely regretful that he doesn’t have the item in your size. He just turned 41 but could pass for mid-20s. His tousled hair is rust-coloured, his skin frantic with freckles, his lips so plump they look like crimson jellies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/27/eddie-redmayne-until-theres-a-levelling-there-are-certain-parts-i-wouldnt-play">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Attack the Block director’s paranormal young adult series is playful, intelligent and full of British charm. He has such a knack for nurturing young talent</p><p>Following the runaway success of Wednesday and Stranger Things, Netflix has gambled on another gothy young adult show, similarly primed to become impressionable teens’ entire personalities. Lockwood and Co – created by Joe Cornish – is a lore-heavy supernatural series set in an alternative modern Britain where an epidemic of ghosts has raged for 50 years, but the only people able to see and fight them are children. To deal with “the problem” there are ghost-hunting agencies run by adults, who use the children to locate the angry spirits and destroy the “source” from which they emanate.</p><p>Despite the title, the central role is held by Lucy Carlisle (played by Ruby Stokes), and much of the first episode is devoted to her origin story, starting as a 12-year-old who can hear ghosts. Her northern town is filled with disaffected, unemployed adults, and she is sent to work at an adult-run agency by a brutal mother who growls that she has no choice as “your father left us with nothing when he drank himself to death”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/27/lockwood-and-co-review-joe-cornishs-teen-ghosthunters-are-an-absolute-delight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Walsall look to catch the eye against Leicester, Liverpool seek revenge at Brighton and intriguing games in Manchester</p><p>The Walsall manager, Michael Flynn, was very unhappy about the news that his side’s clash with Leicester would not be aired on a main UK channel. “I think it is a disgrace our game hasn’t been chosen, it is what the FA Cup is all about,” he said. His argument is more than a fair one when Manchester United v Reading will be available on Saturday night. League Two clubs such as Walsall heavily rely on TV money from cup runs to help with finances, more than the likes of United topping up their coffers. It is up to Flynn and his squad to prove TV bosses wrong by pulling off an upset inside a packed Bescot Stadium on Saturday. TV companies need to acknowledge what the FA Cup is about. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p><p><em>Walsall v Leicester, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p><p><em>Brighton v Liverpool, Sunday 1.30pm</em></p><p><em>Wrexham v Sheffield United, Sunday 4.30pm</em></p><p><em>Derby County v West Ham, Monday 7.45pm</em></p><p><em>Preston v Tottenham, Saturday 6pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/27/fa-cup-fourth-round-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>
