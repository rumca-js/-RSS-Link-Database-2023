The president spent much of the last two years encouraging lawmakers to pass a bill that would have reformed policing with the aim of stopping such killings, but the effort ultimately failed.

Some in the party, most notable the Florida governor, <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, have said it’s time for change at the top of the GOP after it underperformed in two consecutive elections.</p><p>The <strong>White House press secretary,</strong> <strong>Karine Jean-Pierre,</strong> will brief reporters at 2pm.</p><p><strong>The House of Representatives</strong> has convened and will consider a bill to restrict the president’s ability to withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve unless there is an increase in the percentage of federal land from which oil and gas is being produced.
