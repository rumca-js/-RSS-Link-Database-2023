A classicist and self-styled eclectic, he nevertheless drew on the musical language of the Romantic era in which he lived, but eccentrically insisted that personal emotion should ideally play no part in composition, a curious stance that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/02/saint-saens-proms-unfashionable-underrated-and-overdue-for-reappraisal\">his own work</a> predictably more than once contradicts.

Most interpreters think of the Organ Symphony (No 3) as being about decibels and immensity, where Emelyanychev views it in terms of tautness and clarity. This is not to say that the ending didn\u2019t raise the roof (James McVinnie was the excellent organist), but the lean sound of period instruments confers transparency on music that can often seem over-plush. And what was so remarkable here was the level of detail, with every note and shift in texture hitting home, from the whirring strings of the first movement\u2019s allegro to the complex brass writing in the ceremonial finale. Emelyanychev\u2019s way with the symphony\u2019s structural logic, keenly exposing the cut and thrust of its musical argument, was immaculate too.</p><p>To be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 28 March</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/27/oae-emelyanychev-review-royal-festival-hall-london\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/27/do-i-like-interviews-no-fighting-for-words-with-the-evasive-artur-beterbiev", "title": "\u2018Do I like interviews?
