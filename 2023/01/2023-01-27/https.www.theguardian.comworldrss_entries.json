This evening, police in Memphis will release video of <strong>Tyre Nichols</strong> being beaten to death by five officers who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/27/tyre-nichols-death-memphis-video-police-rodney-king\">yesterday charged with murder</a>. Amid fears the footage could raise tensions over policing and racial justice nationwide, <strong>Joe Biden</strong> yesterday called for \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d and condemned acts of violence. At the Capitol, police are <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/26/capitol-police-boost-security-preparations-ahead-of-tyre-nichols-footage-release-00079816?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=12069c7e-e346-405c-ad2c-71cb1a62e514&amp;nlid=630318\">reportedly</a> increasing security to get ahead of potential unrest. The president spent much of the last two years encouraging lawmakers to pass a bill that would have reformed policing with the aim of stopping such killings, but the effort ultimately failed.

Some in the party, most notable the Florida governor, <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, have said it\u2019s time for change at the top of the GOP after it underperformed in two consecutive elections.</p><p>The <strong>White House press secretary,</strong> <strong>Karine Jean-Pierre,</strong> will brief reporters at 2pm.</p><p><strong>The House of Representatives</strong> has convened and will consider a bill to restrict the president\u2019s ability to withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve unless there is an increase in the percentage of federal land from which oil and gas is being produced.
