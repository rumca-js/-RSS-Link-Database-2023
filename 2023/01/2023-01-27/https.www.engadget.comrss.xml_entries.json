It's not certain who would star, but we wouldn't count on movie stars Angelina Jolie or Alicia Vikander reprising the role of Lara Croft. The show is reportedly still in the development stage.</p><p>We've asked Amazon for comment. A collaboration like this wouldn't be surprising, at least. Amazon is publishing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-games-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-173848481.html\">the next Tomb Raider game</a>, and Waller-Bridge previously struck a three-year deal with Amazon that includes projects like the novel adaptation <em>Sign Here</em>. Sources for <em>The Reporter</em> claim Amazon was &quot;aggressive&quot; in pursuing a deal renewal late last year.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The rumor comes as game-based TV shows have their moment in the spotlight. HBO's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-season-one-hbo-review-080135969.html\"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> has already been successful enough to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hbo-the-last-of-us-season-two-first-episode-streaming-free-173738551.html\">get a second season</a>. Sony, meanwhile, is prepping <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-horizon-god-of-war-gran-turismo-tv-shows-netflix-amazon-playstation-144132163.html\">God of War, Gran Turismo and Horizon</a> titles for Netflix and Prime Video. A Tomb Raider series would bolster Amazon's game-themed catalog and help it compete against rivals like Netflix, which already has hits like the <em>League of Legends</em> offshoot <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html\"><em>Arcane</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Amazon also hasn't been shy about chasing after potential blockbusters. The company reportedly spent $1 billion on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-was-amazon-primes-most-watched-debut-ever-075410830.html\"><em>The Lord of Rings: The Rings of Power</em></a>, for instance. While a Tomb Raider show isn't likely to be as lavish, Waller-Bridge's involvement suggests Amazon is eager for a hit. Amazon struggled to breach the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/most-streamed-tv-show-2022-stranger-things-182044165.html\">top streaming charts last year</a> \u2014 this might give it better ammunition against Netflix successes like <em>Stranger Things</em>.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-music-generator-210728046.html?src=rss", "title": "Google AI can create music in any genre from a text description", "date_published": "2023-01-27 21:07:28+00:00", "description": "<p>Never mind <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-passes-graduate-law-business-exams-210146640.html\">ChatGPT</a> \u2014 music might be the next big frontier for AI content generation. Google recently <a href=\"https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/\">published</a> research on MusicLM, a system that creates music in any genre with a text description. This isn't the first AI music generator. As <em>TechCrunch</em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/google-created-an-ai-that-can-generate-music-from-text-descriptions-but-wont-release-it/\">notes</a>, projects like Google's AudioML and OpenAI's Jukebox have tackled the subject. However, MusicLM's model and vast training database (280,000 hours of music) help it produce music with surprising variety and depth. You might just like the output.</p><p>The AI can not only combine genres and instruments, but write tracks using abstract concepts that are normally difficult for computers to grasp. If you want a hybrid of dance music and reggaeton with a &quot;spacey, otherworldly&quot; tune that evokes a &quot;sense of wonder and awe,&quot; MusicLM can make it happen. The technology can even craft melodies based on humming, whistling or the description of a painting. A story mode can stitch several descriptions together to produce a DJ set or soundtrack.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>MusicLM has its problems, as with many AI generators. Some compositions sound strange, and vocals tend to be incomprehensible. And while the performances themselves are better than you'd expect, they can be repetitive in ways human works might not. Don't expect an EDM-style drop or the verse-chorus-verse pattern of a typical song.</p><p>Just don't plan on using the tech any time soon. As with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-imagen-text-to-image-ai-unprecedented-photorealism-144205123.html\">other Google AI generators</a>, the researchers aren't releasing MusicLM to the public over copyright concerns. Roughly one percent of the music produced at the time of publication was copied directly from the training songs. While questions regarding licensing for AI music haven't been settled, a 2021 <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&amp;context=jlt\">whitepaper </a>from Eric Sunray (now working for the Music Publishers Association) suggested that there's enough &quot;coherent&quot; traces of the original sounds that AI music can violate reproduction rights. You may have to get clearances to release AI-created songs, much like musicians who rely on samples.</p><p>AI already has a place in music. Artists like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/holly-plus-holly-herndon-dolly-parton-jolene-ai-cover-204750236.html\">Holly Herndon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-17-arca-ai-soundtrack-for-nyc-moma.html\">Arca</a> have used algorithms to produce albums and museum soundtracks. However, those are either collaborative (as with Herndon) or intentionally unpredictable (like Arca's).

When engaged, the system handles lane-keeping duties, stays with the flow of traffic, navigates to destinations programmed into the Nav system, and will even react to &quot;unexpected traffic situations and handles them independently, e.g. by evasive maneuvers within the lane or by braking maneuvers.&quot;</p><p>To perform these feats, the Drive Pilot system relies on a suite of sensors embedded throughout the vehicle including visual cameras, LiDAR arrays, radar and ultrasound sensors, and audio mics to keep an ear out for approaching emergency vehicles. The system even compares its onboard sensor data with what it is receiving from its GPS to ensure it knows exactly where on the road it actually is.&nbsp;</p><p>Drive Pilot is only available on the 2024 S-Class and EQS Sedan for now.

Three months later, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Cb3dlcnMtV2lsa2lucy1CbHVldG9vdGgtSGVhZHBob25lcy1DYW5jZWxsYXRpb24vZHAvQjBCMzNQWFBKVD90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWkzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlMTIxMmE3OS1kOGE3LTRiZGEtODNjNi1jZTljNmIwM2Q5ODgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUHJVOujZcMvdqtGhzEmRj8OseK6oIPp0W7PIsSiJg94&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBowers-Wilkins-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancellation%2Fdp%2FB0B33PXPJT%3Fth%3D1\">Px8</a> arrived. While the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-headphones-price-specs-070021776.html\">Px8</a> carries a similar look to its predecessor, Bowers &amp; Wilkins crafted this set of headphones out of more luxurious materials and managed to improve what was already great sound quality. However, the upgrades come at a steep price: the $699 Px8 is $300 more than the Px7 S2.</p><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><p>At a glance, the Px8 looks nearly identical to the Px7 S2 Bowers &amp; Wilkins debuted last year. Upon close inspection though, the differences become apparent. The Px8 has a slightly more refined aesthetic, with soft leather replacing the woven fabric on the outside of the headband and ear cups. The outermost panels of the earcups, where the company\u2019s wordmark resides, is now metal instead of plastic. And the arms and headband slider are cast aluminum, further complementing the more premium design.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Px8 weighs 13 grams more than the Px7 S2, which is probably (at least partially) due to the change in materials. Memory foam ear cushions keep things comfy, but you can feel the extra load if you\u2019re doing a side-by-side comparison. For that reason, I give a slight edge to the S2 if you need something to wear for several hours at a time. After a Vegas to Atlanta flight this month, I was starting to feel the added weight \u2013 and also the rings around the ear cups.</p><p>On-board controls are still physical buttons on the Px8, and they\u2019re in the exact same locations as the Px7 S2. On the right, a power/pairing slider sits above a trio of buttons for volume, playback and calls. Over on the left side, a single control toggles between active noise cancellation (ANC), transparency mode and both off. While some companies have nixed buttons in favor of touch panels, those aren\u2019t always reliable, but what Bowers &amp; Wilkins offers here certainly gets the job done.</p><h2><strong>Software</strong></h2><p></p><figure><img alt=\"The Px8 are some of the best sounding headphones we\u2019ve ever reviewed. Bowers &amp; Wilkins blend of extremely clear sound with a wide open soundstage makes these a joy to listen to. However, they\u2019re lacking in the comfort department and one basic feature still needs refining. Due to the $699 price, the company\u2019s Px7 S2 is a better option for most people.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/37f202d0-9e6b-11ed-b5fe-5f21ae1fd93a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Bowers &amp; Wilkins Music app gives you access to all of the settings on the Px8, just like it has for the company\u2019s previous headphones. On the main screen, there\u2019s up-to-date battery status with noise mode selection just below (ANC, Pass-through and off). You can also manage connections here as the Px8 supports multipoint Bluetooth with two devices. Lastly, the company has put media controls (if you link compatible services), tone settings, a quick start guide and product support right on that first panel.</p><p>Once you dive deeper into the settings section, battery life percentage and noise mode (or Environmental Control as the company calls it) are prominently displayed once more. Treble and bass sliders are there as well, allowing for <em>very</em> basic EQ tweaks. The company hasn\u2019t provided any presets here, so you\u2019re left with those two variables to adjust. The ability to manage connections is repeated here as well, just above the option to reassign the Quick Action button on the left earcup. By default, it cycles between sound modes. However, if you prefer, you can make it summon a voice assistant.</p><p>The last two notable items have to do with power management. First, Bowers &amp; WIlkins offers an automatic standby feature that activates a low power state after 15 minutes of inactivity. You can switch it off if you\u2019d like. The second tool is the ability to activate or disable the wear sensor for automatic pausing. The company says this should pause music when you lift one earcup, but that isn\u2019t always the case. Bowers &amp; Wilkins gives you three sensitivity options to help fine-tune it (low, medium and high), but none of those remedy the fact that the Px8 \u2013 like the Px7 S2 \u2013 is slow to pause when you lift an ear cup or take them off your head. This could still use some work so that at the very least audio resumes quicker after a break.</p><h2><strong>Sound quality</strong></h2><figure><img alt=\"The Px8 are some of the best sounding headphones we\u2019ve ever reviewed. Bowers &amp; Wilkins blend of extremely clear sound with a wide open soundstage makes these a joy to listen to. However, they\u2019re lacking in the comfort department and one basic feature still needs refining. Due to the $699 price, the company\u2019s Px7 S2 is a better option for most people.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/37de53c0-9e6b-11ed-bfff-22da0871b868\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>One key area the Px8 differs from the Px7 S2 is sound quality. Where the latter packs in a pair of 40mm bio cellulose drivers, the former is equipped with two carbon units of the same size. I\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t know enough about headphone construction to tell you if one is technically better than the other, but what I do know is that the Px8 sounds incredible. The Px7 S2 already had great audio quality, but Bowers &amp; Wilkins somehow manages to take things a step further with this model.</p><p>There\u2019s a warmth to the sound profile that invites you to sit and listen a while, no matter the genre. An almost extreme clarity to the audio keeps the most chaotic metal perfectly organized, allowing you to pick out individual instruments. And in the case of Underoath\u2019s <em>Voyuerist</em>, it\u2019s easy to distinguish the backing synth even when it\u2019s very subtle or laid underneath the full band going flat out. The amount of detail the Px8 exudes from bluegrass and jazz tracks is staggering, making it seem like you\u2019re in the room with B\u00e9la Fleck as he recorded <em>My Bluegrass Heart.</em> It\u2019s not <em>just </em>banjo, guitar, bass, mandolin and fiddle. You can hear the nuance in the sound of each one as they envelope you.</p><p>And it\u2019s more than the clarity and detail. The Px8 is a well-tuned powerhouse for bass-heavy electronic music and hip-hop too. When a track demands it, these headphones tap into a stash of low-end that rivals some of the best. And like everything else, you can hear the subtlety in the kick drum, drum machine and bass line. That\u2019s true across the board, whether it\u2019s bombastic beats of <em>RTJ4 </em>or the intricate synth work on Sylvan Esso\u2019s <em>No Rules Sandy</em>.</p><p>In terms of active noise cancellation, the Px8 does an admirable job. It\u2019s not miles better than the Px7 S2, but in nearly every circumstance \u2013 including on an airplane \u2013 these headphones are up to the task. Bose and Sony manage to block out more on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html\">the QuietComfort 45</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html\">the WH-1000XM5</a> respectively, but Bowers &amp; Wilkins didn\u2019t phone it in here. There\u2019s some solid ANC performance, it\u2019s just not the absolute best.</p><h2><strong>Call quality</strong></h2><p>Bowers &amp; Wilkins says it moved two of the six on-board microphones closer together and re-angled them to improve voice quality. The company explained that these tweaks should also reduce wind noise. Call audio for the person on the other end was already good on the Px7 S2, but the lack of a natural-sounding transparency mode made me feel a bit shouty during voice and video chats. On the Px8, that pass-through audio is still good, but not great, and not as natural sounding as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html\">the AirPods Max</a>.</p><p>The Px8 does a great job of cutting down on background noise, though, so the headphones will help whoever is on the other end focus on your voice. However, overall voice quality isn\u2019t great as you\u2019ll still sound like you\u2019re on speaker phone rather than having a decent mic near your face. Are they fine for most video and voice calls? Sure. If you\u2019re doing those things often should you consider these as your primary tool? Probably not.</p><h2><strong>Battery life</strong></h2><figure><img alt=\"The Px8 are some of the best sounding headphones we\u2019ve ever reviewed.

Due to the $699 price, the company\u2019s Px7 S2 is a better option for most people.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/37f202d1-9e6b-11ed-bf11-9e96b72e2082\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Bowers &amp; Wilkins has a track record of under promising and over delivering when it comes to battery life on its headphones. The company consistently outperforms the stated figure by a mile and the same is true on the Px8. Much like the Px7 S2, this model still had 40 percent left in the tank at the 30-hour mark \u2013 the company\u2019s official rating. And yes, that\u2019s with active noise cancellation turned on over the course of a few days, plus the occasional use of transparency mode for calls. After 30 hours on the Px7 S2, there was 33 percent left, so the Px8 seems to be slightly more efficient than its more affordable sibling \u2013 or perhaps has a slightly bigger battery.</p><p>The company has included a quick-charge feature that gives you seven hours of listening time in 15 minutes. That\u2019s nice if you find yourself in a pinch, but with well over 30 hours of ANC use available, I\u2019m only charging once a week after using the Px8 a few hours each day. The battery life here stacks up well against the best you can get in noise-canceling headphones right now.</p><h2><strong>The competition</strong></h2><p>At $699, the Px8 is the most expensive set of wireless noise-canceling headphones I\u2019ve reviewed. Even Master &amp; Dynamic\u2019s priciest model is $100 cheaper (the MW75). You have to <em>really </em>dig what Bowers &amp; Wilkins is putting down to dive in here. Simply put, there are great alternatives available for less \u2013 some of which offer more features. Heck, I\u2019d argue the company\u2019s own Px7 S2 is a better value at $399.</p><p>The Px7 S2 may not have the high-end look of the Px8, but it does have excellent sound quality, solid ANC performance and better-than-advertised battery life. The company\u2019s warm, crisp and clear audio is on display on the more affordable model and it\u2019s more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Aside from the boost in overall sound quality and that refined design, the Px7 S2 has every other feature you get on the Px8 \u2013 for a lot less.</p><p>At this point, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html\">Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM5</a> is still <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html\">the best you can buy</a>, mostly for the mix of audio and noise-canceling performance, with a long list of handy features on the side. The two most notable are the M5\u2019s ability to automatically change sound modes based on your location or activity and the Speak-to-Chat tool that pauses the audio when you begin to speak. Simply put, no other company comes close to packing in as much as Sony.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>When a pair of headphones costs <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Cb3dlcnMtV2lsa2lucy1CbHVldG9vdGgtSGVhZHBob25lcy1DYW5jZWxsYXRpb24vZHAvQjBCMzNQWFBKVD90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWkzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlMTIxMmE3OS1kOGE3LTRiZGEtODNjNi1jZTljNmIwM2Q5ODgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUHJVOujZcMvdqtGhzEmRj8OseK6oIPp0W7PIsSiJg94&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBowers-Wilkins-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancellation%2Fdp%2FB0B33PXPJT%3Fth%3D1\">$699</a>, I start to expect things. Mainly that they need to be damn near perfect for me to recommend them. The Px8 nearly is when it comes to sound quality, but there are other areas where they fall short of the company\u2019s previous model and some of the competition. Automatic pausing is still in need of refinement, even with the sensitivity settings. And overall, the Px7 S2 is much more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Bowers &amp; Wilkins impresses with this most premium offering, but there are still some rough edges to smooth out.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/most-streamed-tv-show-2022-stranger-things-182044165.html?src=rss", "title": "'Stranger Things' helped Netflix dominate the streaming charts in 2022", "date_published": "2023-01-27 18:20:44+00:00", "description": "<p>You might not be stuck inside watching shows like you were at the height of the pandemic, but there were clearly some favorite online titles last year.

For context, the second-place crime drama <em>NCIS</em> managed 'just' 38.1 billion minutes.</p><p>Netflix otherwise dominated the charts, though not completely. It  was responsible for 10 out of the top 15 overall shows, and 13 of the 15 most popular originals. However, there was some competition. The vast back catalog at Disney+ helped it claim three places on the overall chart (including <em>Encanto</em> in fifth place), and its kid-friendly library gave it 10 spots in the movie rankings. Amazon Prime Video only had two titles break into the top 15 originals, <em>The Boys</em> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-was-amazon-primes-most-watched-debut-ever-075410830.html\"><em>The Rings of Power</em></a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>Stranger Things</em> didn't manage an all-time high. That honor goes to <em>The Office</em>, which managed 57.1 billion minutes thanks to many more episodes (192 versus 34) and 2020 pandemic lockdowns. It's still a significant feat, though, and Nielsen points out that some shows took much less time to climb the ranks than others. <em>Encanto</em> had all year, while the Addams Family spinoff <em>Wednesday</em> managed a similar achievement (12th overall) in 36 days.</p><p>Nielsen also found that streaming was up as a whole. Americans streamed over 19.4 million years of content in 2022, a 27 percent jump versus the year before. That was largely due to both the wider range of services and, crucially, a wider range of originals. Audiences were more likely to stream internet-only shows than dive into licensed TV material, and that boosted the industry as a whole.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/hbo-the-last-of-us-season-two-first-episode-streaming-free-173738551.html?src=rss", "title": "HBO renews 'The Last of Us' for a second season", "date_published": "2023-01-27 17:37:38+00:00", "description": "<p>Get ready for more clickers, quips from Ellie and perhaps <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-070140792.html\">a trip to a decaying Seattle</a>: HBO has renewed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/the%20last%20of%20us/\"><em><ins>The Last of Us</ins></em></a> for <a href=\"https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-renews-last-us-second-season\"><ins>a second season</ins></a>.

You'd only have to tell the voice assistant what you want \u2014 you could have digital animals scurrying around the room without the need for modelling, animation or conventional programming software.</p><p>The AR creation tool is said to be based on technology from Fabric Software, a Canadian company Apple quietly bought in 2017. The acquired startup's Fabric Engine let developers automatically create environments and objects using procedural generation, a technique used in games like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/no-mans-sky-outlaws-update-space-pirate-hello-games-141127146.html\"><em>No Man's Sky</em></a>. A Fabric co-founder, Peter Zion, is believed to be running the development tool project. Apple also bought DigitalRune, which sought to make 3D game development easier, in 2016.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Apple might also save you the trouble of creating unique objects for headset apps. You could scan and import objects that, if all goes well, would look and behave realistically. You wouldn't have to rely on Apple-made stock models. Existing like Object Capture (which creates 3D models from iPhone photos) and RoomPlan (for virtual floor plans) are apparently part of these efforts.</p><p>The company has already declined comment. The state of the Siri-based development tool isn't known, but the sources say Apple's original plan was to release the suite at the same time as the headset. Current rumors have the wearable arriving as soon as this spring.&nbsp;</p><p>According to past rumors, the initial mixed reality headset (possibly named Reality Pro) may be very expensive and aimed more at professionals than everyday users. However, leaks suggest Apple is still building features that would appeal to a mainstream audience, such as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-headset-full-body-renders-facetime-202004300.html\">FaceTime calls with avatars</a> as well as health and fitness apps that could include a meditation experience.

It has the largest screen of any Apple Watch to date and it's the most rugged version the company has built.

The company has even teased a few details, such as camera and performance upgrades. But will this phone lineup be a major revision, or a modest yearly refresh? Let\u2019s take a look at what you\u2019re likely to see when Samsung takes to the stage in San Francisco.</p><h2>Galaxy S23 Ultra</h2><h2></h2><p>If the Galaxy S22 Ultra\u2019s main appeal was its Note-style pen functionality, the S23 Ultra may revolve around its camera system. Rumors from leaker Ice Universe and others have long <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1568533962330611712\">pointed</a> to the highest-end S23 model sporting a 200-megapixel main camera, and Samsung added fuel to the discussion by unveiling a sensor that could fit the bill. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unveils-200-megapixel-sensor-thats-likely-to-appear-in-the-galaxy-s-23-090043536.html\">ISOCELL HP2</a> promises extremely detailed photos and 8K video at 30 frames per second while still offering solid low-light capabilities. It might also capture more accurate colors in brightly-lit scenarios. The front camera may get a slight bump to 12MP as well.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"1cf932141786454893fd01010d06b516\"></div><p>It won\u2019t surprise you to hear that Samsung is poised to give the S23 family a speed boost with Qualcomm\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/qualcomms-snapdragon-8-gen-2-chip-offers-hardware-accelerated-ray-tracing-230008445.html\">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a>. It\u2019s supposedly over 25 percent faster than Gen 1 while offering hardware-accelerated ray tracing for more realistic lighting in games. You may see up to a fourfold improvement in AI processing, too. Qualcomm claims Gen 2 is up to 40 percent more energy efficient, and you might get emergency satellite communication in addition to WiFi 7 networking.</p><p>However, the biggest shock may be where you find that chip. Well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims Samsung will use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 to power the Galaxy S23 in every country, rather than using its in-house Exynos chips in regions like Asia and Europe. Critics have routinely knocked Exynos-based Galaxy phones for having worse performance and battery life than their Snapdragon counterparts, but that might not be an issue this time around.</p><p>You may not see other sweeping changes, but that\u2019s not necessarily a problem. If leaked <a href=\"https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/Samsung-Galaxy-S23-Ultra#Exclusief-Samsung-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-renders-binnen\">images</a> at <em>Nieuwe Mobiel</em> are accurate, the Galaxy S23 Ultra will have a slightly flatter design than its predecessor, addressing complaints about the 6.8-inch screen\u2019s curved edges. You\u2019d still find a 12MP ultra-wide camera, dual 10MP telephoto lenses, an S-Pen and up to 12GB of RAM. You may get a 1TB storage option, though, so you might not have to worry as much about that 8K footage chewing up all your free space.</p><h2>Galaxy S23 and S23+</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy S23+ leak\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/2f314e90-9e56-11ed-bba3-a7ce25e95469\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Samsung</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Samsung\u2019s more mainstream smartphones aren\u2019t expected to receive as dramatic an update, but there could still be meaningful improvements. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and the rumored 12MP front camera might arrive alongside an ever-so-slightly larger battery. The phones could also ship with 256GB of storage as the baseline \u2014 important if you\u2019d rather not spend extra just to hold a sizable media collection.</p><p>Otherwise we\u2019ll probably get the familiar 6.1- and 6.6-inch displays of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s-22-review-sprucing-up-a-solid-foundation-151522033.html\">Galaxy S22</a> line, not to mention a 50MP main rear camera, a 12MP ultra-wide and a lone 10MP telephoto.

But with a good racing wheel and pedals, those finer sensations \u2013 bumping over a curb, transitioning from concrete to dirt, fighting through a tight corner as your car resists \u2013 are more intimate. The way a wheel forces me to put my whole body into steering the car only makes me more connected and engaged. And in competitive games, its granularity can be a great benefit.

It\u2019s a clear step behind the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-drive_sim_racing_wheel\">direct drive wheels</a> that exist at the top end of this market, but I\u2019m more of an enthusiast than a high-level sim racer. And at $450, it\u2019s about as much as I can consciously invest in a game controller, especially a niche one. After roughly six months of use, however, I can confidently recommend it to others upgrading from an entry-level wheel, or those who are looking to buy their first wheel and know they\u2019ll make use of the extra investment.</p><figure><img alt=\"The pedals included with the Thrustmaster T300 RS GT Edition racing wheel resting on the ground.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/6c641f00-9ce8-11ed-a3e5-af26583733c1\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>The T300RS gives a favorable impression out of the box. Though the wheel is coated in rubber (rather than the G29\u2019s leather), it\u2019s grippy, sturdy and pleasingly smooth. The three metal pedals feel cool and solid, and their base stays in place regardless of how much force I put down. The full set of gamepad buttons built into the wheel are easy enough to reach, and the metallic paddle shifters on the back of the wheel have a tight click when changing gears. The wheel is also completely detachable from its base, on the off chance I ever want to pop on a <a href=\"https://www.thrustmaster.com/en-us/universe/racing/\">different one</a> instead.</p><p>This is a Gran Turismo-branded wheel, and since Gran Turismo is a PlayStation franchise, all the buttons follow PlayStation\u2019s iconography. Thrustmaster <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/thrustmaster-t300rs-gt-edition-wheel,33095.html\">launched this wheel</a> back in 2016, so it\u2019s plug-and-play with the PS5, PS4 and PS3 (which I appreciate as someone who enjoys <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/retroid-pocket-3-irl-153508438.html\">revisiting older games</a>). The device also works on PC, but, unsurprisingly, Xbox and Nintendo consoles aren\u2019t supported.</p><p>The wheel\u2019s multi-piece mounting setup requires more work to attach to a desk than the Logitech wheel\u2019s built-in clamps, but it\u2019s not arduous enough to be a serious hindrance. The wheelbase is on the heavy side, though and, as with any wheel, you\u2019ll want to have ample space to hook everything up.</p><p>Once it\u2019s locked in, the T300RS GT Edition gives me little to complain about. The point of a racing wheel is to effectively communicate what your virtual car is doing. This does that. When I start to lose grip after taking a corner too hot, I feel it, and I can tell what subtle corrections I need to make to regain control. It\u2019s not as true-to-life as a direct drive wheel, but its belt-driven force feedback is powerful and strikingly smooth, unlike the stepped sensation I\u2019d get with the G29. It\u2019s also noticeably less noisy than the Logitech wheel, which is great when I want to get in a few races later at night.</p><p>Likewise, it didn\u2019t take me long to get used to the pedals, and within a few races I had a good sense of how much force was needed to properly feather the accelerator or fully brake. In general, the pedals don\u2019t require significant pressure, which I like. Still, you can adjust the pedal sensitivity, among other bits, through the <a href=\"https://support.thrustmaster.com/en/product/t300rs-en/\">wheel\u2019s settings</a> on a PC.</p><p>One consequence of this motorized setup is that it needs internal fans and heatsinks to keep itself cool. When you\u2019re pushing it, a fan at the top of the wheelbase will blow out hot air. It\u2019s quiet, but you can sometimes smell it. Cranking the feedback effects isn\u2019t the wisest idea for this kind of wheel\u2019s long-term durability, either, so it\u2019s worth keeping the force feedback at a moderate level more generally.</p><p>The GT Edition here is a variant of Thrustmaster\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thrustmaster.com/products/t300rs/\">standard T300RS</a>, which is usually <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvVGhydXN0bWFzdGVyLVQzMDBSUy1PZmZpY2lhbGx5LUxpY2Vuc2VkLUZvcmNlLUZlZWRiYWNrLVJhY2luZy1XaGVlbC1QUzQtUFMzLzQxOTc1MTIxIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlOWFiOGViMy05MDNlLTQ0ZTAtYjgyMy0yZjgyYTE5MTdlZjkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQbc2GXNV4cg-oWKG2uzcK1IHhsjHsQclPg-3SDbB0-T&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FThrustmaster-T300RS-Officially-Licensed-Force-Feedback-Racing-Wheel-PS4-PS3%2F41975121\">$50 or so cheaper</a>. (Both wheels look to be having stock issues as of this writing.) The main difference, besides the GT branding, is that the former has a nicer-feeling three-pedal set with a built-in clutch pedal. The latter just has gas and brake pedals. The GT Edition also includes a spongy \u201cconical brake mod\u201d that you can stick behind the brake to provide a more realistic sense of resistance, though I prefer the looser feel of driving without it. The pedal upgrade of the GT Edition was worth the extra change for me, but, to be clear, the two wheels are otherwise the same, and it\u2019s always possible to <a href=\"https://flowracers.com/blog/load-cell-pedals-benefits/\">upgrade either model\u2019s pedals</a> down the line.</p><p>You should view all of my praise here on a curve. Hardcore racers who <em>only</em> play sims like <a href=\"https://www.iracing.com/\">iRacing</a> or <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/365960/rFactor_2/\">rFactor 2</a> can do better, and they already know that. A racing wheel isn\u2019t some magic cheat code, either: A gamepad user will be faster than wheel user if they\u2019ve spent more time perfecting their lines and braking points on a given track. If anything, using a wheel for the first time can feel like learning to drive again.</p><p>Still, the T300RS GT Edition should be an ideal performer for new converts and moderate enthusiasts looking to upgrade. Even if it\u2019s been around for a while, there still aren\u2019t that many belt-driven alternatives that are truly competing with it in its price range.</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-agrees-to-provide-eu-users-clearer-information-on-shopping-flights-and-more-134313784.html?src=rss", "title": "Google agrees to provide clearer information on its services to EU users", "date_published": "2023-01-27 13:43:13+00:00", "description": "<p>Google has agreed to provide clearer information to users browsing Google Store, Google Play Store, Google Hotels and Google Flights in Europe, the EU Commission announced in a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_367\">press release</a>.

It features a newer Ryzen 7 6800U CPU that pumps out frame rates between 25 to 40 percent higher than the Steam Deck, while its sophisticated hall sensor joysticks deliver even more responsive controls. The Ayaneo 2 also features a seven-inch bezel-less LCD display with a higher 1,920 x 1,200 resolution and tons of connectivity, thanks to three USB-C ports. Crucially, it's based on Windows 11 instead of SteamOS, which means it should run practically any game you can think of. The main downsides are somewhat short battery life (about two and a half hours on a charge), the lack of built-in touchpads and a starting price $450 higher than the Steam Deck. Yeah, that's about double.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-2-review-specs-price-a-more-premium-and-pricier-take-on-the-steam-deck-143039617.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hive-ransomware-doj-fbi-disruption-193249866.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...\">DOJ says it disrupted a major global ransomware group</a></h2><h3>The agency claims the infiltration has thwarted over $130 million in ransom demands.</h3><h3></h3><p>The US Department of Justice has spent months infiltrating and disrupting the Hive ransomware group, the agency announced on Thursday.

The analyst also explained that it's riskier for Apple to use its own WiFi chips at a time when companies are switching their devices over to WiFi 6E. &quot;Broadcom will be the biggest winner&quot; in this situation, he said, since the iPhone 15 is expected to feature the new WiFi standard that allows access to the 6 GHz band.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"4d3ac762046f47ef8c119bbbf75ffbd5\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">(1/2)<br />Apple has halted developing its own Wi-Fi chips; Broadcom is the biggest winner of the iPhone 15\u2019s upgrade to Wi-Fi 6E and the leading beneficiary of the Wi-Fi industry-standard upgrade to Wi-Fi 6E/7 with higher ASP.<a href=\"https://t.co/XEZ0bVV8A8\">https://t.co/XEZ0bVV8A8</a></p>\u2014 \u90ed\u660e\u9324 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1618662910217310209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 26, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>While it's unclear if Apple will ever release its own WiFi chip, <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman said the company's wireless chipset ambition isn't entirely dead. In Kuo's Twitter thread about the report, Gurman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1618669606402662401\">chimed in</a> and said that the tech giant is still working on a combined WiFi-Bluetooth chip.
