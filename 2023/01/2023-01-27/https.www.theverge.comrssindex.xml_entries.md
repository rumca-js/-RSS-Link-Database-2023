  <p id="63XDZl">When Jonathan Majors takes to the bodybuilding competition stage in writer / director Elijah Bynum’s arresting new drama <em>Magazine Dreams</em>, it’s impossible not to feel as if the movie’s in direct conversation with the way that its lead star’s fame <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a41495793/jonathan-majors-kang-marvel-creed-interview/">has become wrapped up in</a> the public’s <a href="https://people.com/movies/jonathan-majors-on-his-viral-shirtless-photo-and-special-bond-with-devotion-costar-glen-powell/">fascination with his body</a>. <em>Magazine Dreams</em>’ deep dive into the life of an obsessive, aspiring pro lifter longing for a shot at fitness fame is one of the most difficult pieces of cinema to debut at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. But as it’s breaking your heart and making you sweat, <em>Magazine Dreams </em>is also laying bare many painful truths about what it means to be trapped in a world where objectification and dehumanization are the prices you have to pay...</p>

  <p id="BSedRa">Amazon is developing a TV series based on the <em>Tomb Raider</em> video game franchise with scripts written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/tomb-raider-tv-show-amazon-phoebe-waller-bridge-1235311582/">according to <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>. Details are light on this new <em>Tomb Raider</em> series, but <em>THR</em> says that while Waller-Bridge will serve as a writer and executive producer, she won’t be starring in the show. The show is apparently still in the development stages, so we probably shouldn’t expect to see it anytime soon.</p>
<p id="qgwxjo">This new series could be another potentially big video game franchise adaptation for Amazon, which announced in December that it would be making <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/14/23509418/god-of-war-amazon-prime-video-tv-show-series">a <em>God of War </em>TV show</a>. But it also marks a further investment from Amazon into the <em>Tomb Raider</em> franchise, as the company will also be publishing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23510923/amazon-tomb-raider-game-crystal-dynamics">the next <em>Tomb...</em></a></p>

<p id="wFTW3U">For totals lower than that, you’ll have to pay a service fee that differs based on how much you buy. Orders between $100 and $150 will have a $3.95 delivery fee, orders between $50 and $100 will have a $6.95 fee, and orders under $50 will have a $9.95 fee.</p>

<p id="B20aqA">Before each heat, each athlete will be given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23353756/apple-watch-series-8-review-smartwatch-wearables">Series 8</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23363948/apple-watch-ultra-review-rugged-smartwatch-gps">Ultra</a> watches preloaded with a specially made WSL Surfer app. The app will connect with the league’s scoring system in real time and give surfers updates on scores, wave priority, and how much time is left in the heat. They’ll also be able to see how many points are needed to either advance or take the lead. The idea is to help surfers better plan and focus...</p>

I’m here to help.</p>
<p id="WdgnZQ">Players familiar with past <em>Fire Emblems</em> might think achieving “S” support rank with a character will give you the option to romance them in<em> Engage</em>. However, there is no “S” rank available in the game, which may lead players to believe “romancing” someone isn’t possible at all. It is, but it works a little differently than how you might expect.</p>

  <p id="lF4qVX">It does not take long for <em>In My Mother’s Skin</em> to get gross. Within its first few minutes, the horror film from writer and director Kenneth Dagatan subjects you to some truly gruesome images of flesh-eating creatures, and honestly, it never really lets up. This is a blood-soaked fairy tale, one that mashes together folklore and history in a way that’s reminiscent of Guillermo del Toro’s defining work, <em>Pan’s Labyrinth</em> — only it’s<em> a lot</em> scarier.</p>
<p id="jlMOyO">The movie is set in the Philippines in 1945 in the waning days of World War II, with Japanese forces occupying the country. Things are bleak.

But <em>Dead Space</em> is a series I’ve found much more fun with a controller than a mouse and keyboard, and I’ve developed an attachment to couch gaming over the past few years — so I’d hoped I might get it to run on my recently acquired Steam Deck, which would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">easily provide both</a>.

Appropriately enough, the speech was in support of a bill that would <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5148/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%22%5D%7D&amp;r=2&amp;s=1">establish a joint AI research center</a> run by the US and Israel. </p>
<p id="0Mwt0d">The speech was written using ChatGPT, and is as dull and anodyne as you might expect for a political speech filtered through an AI system based on probabilistic averages.

  <p id="pyN02B">It seems like Samsung’s planning on charging more for the upcoming Galaxy S23 than it did for the S22, at least in some parts of Europe. Reliable leaker Roland Quandt has been posting prospective prices for the phones at European retailers, and for some models it seems like there will be price jumps of 100 euros or more.</p>
<p id="gju7zK">As an example, <a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1617995844795666432">Quandt says</a> the Galaxy S23 will start at €959 in Spain with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while an Ultra with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage will cost €1,589. Compare that to the S22, whose versions of those phones cost €859 and €1,459 respectively when they’re not on sale, according to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fes%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-s22%2Fbuy%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F1%2F26%2F23573548%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s23-price-increase-europe-spain-denmark" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Samsung’s Spanish site</a>.

  <p id="LWx47B">YouTube is setting the record straight: “Me at the zoo” is still the oldest YouTube video.</p>
<p id="An2vMY">“Me at the zoo,” uploaded <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw&amp;si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE">on April 23rd, 2005</a> and featuring YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim standing in front of elephants at the San Diego Zoo, is an important piece of internet history, as it marks the oldest video on one of the most influential video services on the planet. But earlier on Thursday, a video started circulating that, somehow, had an even earlier upload date: April 5th, 2005.</p>
<p id="y2gbkR">Titled “Welcome to YouTube!!!”, the 48-second video definitely looks like something that could have been used to test out a mid-aughts video website. The video has just one image: a low-res graphic with a YouTube logo with the text “Welcome to YouTube!!!!”...</p>
