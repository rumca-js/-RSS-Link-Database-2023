Right after he banned porn in Florida schools, much to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/don-lemon-florida-law-banning\" target=\"_blank\">Don Lemon's dismay</a>, he's now cracking down on fentanyl dealers who target children. </p><p>I never thought I'd be putting the words \"fentanyl dealers\" in the same sentence as \"children,\" but here we are. Drug dealers are reportedly manufacturing fentanyl that looks like candy to try and broaden their customer base. To children. I guess that's what happens when your product has the potential to kill your customer with just one use. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cDeSantis announces harsher penalties for fentanyl. It will now be \"a first-degree felony to possess, sell, or manufacture fentanyl or other controlled substances to look like candy.\"\\n\\nThose targeting children w/ fentanyl will get a mandatory life sentence and $1 million penalty.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Washington Free Beacon (@Washington Free Beacon)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeBeacon/status/1618687088458878978\">1674760050</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>During a \"Preserving Law and Order in Florida\" press conference, DeSantis proposed legislation making it a \"first-degree felony to possess, sell or manufacture fentanyl or other controlled substances to look like candy.\" Targeting children with the drug would carry a mandatory life sentence and a $1 million fine. </p><p>Last August, the DEA warned of \"rainbow fentanyl\" disguised to look like candy and target young Americans. Some of the fentanyl seized was reportedly designed to look like sidewalk chalk, which struck me as bizarre. I hope no children out there are regularly consuming sidewalk chalk, fentanyl-laced or not. </p><p>DeSantis also <a href=\"https://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/courts-law/2023-01-27/desantis-wants-state-to-look-into-death-penalty-for-child-rapists\" target=\"_blank\">proposed</a> making child rapists eligible for the death penalty and reducing the number of jurors required to issue a death sentence. DeSantis cited the case of Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz, who evaded the death penalty after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict. </p><p>In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty would constitute \"cruel and unusual punishment\" for rapists and is therefore banned under the Eighth Amendment. DeSantis acknowledged his proposal would likely be challenged in court but believes the current Supreme Court would decide the matter differently. </p><p>Overall, Florida is making major moves to protect innocent civilians against criminals. As opposed to say, Chicago, where Mayor <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-mayor-dont-carry-cash\" target=\"_blank\">Lori Lightfoot</a> told her constituents to stop carrying so much cash if they don't want to get robbed. </p><p>It'll be interesting to see how Lori's tactic plays out. My guess is crime. Lots and lots of crime. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

You can get an incurable sexually transmitted disease from drinking out of a water bottle. Not just any water bottle, but a water bottle that someone pissed it. I'm assuming the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/urinating-ex-wifes-grave\" target=\"_blank\">urinator</a> needs to have the STD in order to spread it to you. Regretfully, this is not the only <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pee-diddy-girlfriend\" target=\"_blank\">sex-related tinkle story</a> we've had this week.</p><p>Please enjoy today's episode of The Janitor vs 13 Cubicle Farmers.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"></div><p><a href=\"https://abc13.com/houston-janitor-urinates-in-water-bottles-employees-infected-with-stds-lucio-diaz-charged-civil-lawsuit-filed/12737788/\" target=\"_blank\">ABC-13</a> has the call. Lucio Diaz, the now former janitor, is being charged with indecent assault and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The deadly weapon, as defined by the thirteen victims' attorneys, was Lucio's \"bodily fluids containing Herpes Simplex 1 Virus.\" I'll assume it was JUST urine in the water bottles, and that if it included a little of Lucio's special secret sauce that would have been the lede.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c17bc\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32913883&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>At first, it was four women who filed the lawsuit after coming in contact with Lucio's deadly weapon. Upon hearing of the lawsuit, nine other women from the building had the same allegations and diagnoses.</p><p>The janitor's dastardly plot was uncovered when one of the victims noticed the water out of her water bottle was beginning to taste like pee. So she said up a hidden camera to catch Diaz in action.</p><blockquote>\"[He] pulls out his penis and puts his penis in my bottle, basically rinses his penis in the water.\"</blockquote><p>Further testing showed that the woman contracted Herpes, which the janitor also tested positive for. The lawsuit names the building's owner, the management company, the maintenance company, and the cleaning company that hired Diaz. Attorneys are looking for the maximum amount allowed by Texas law, which is over $1,000,000 per victim.</p><p>Unclear is if Diaz intentionally meant to give the women herpes. Or, unaware he had the STD, just thought peeing in the water would be a hoot.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

Overall, 81% of South Korean respondents stated that they had very negative or somewhat negative views of China, by far the largest percentage out of the 56 countries surveyed. <a href=\"https://ceias.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Europe_and_North_America_Draft-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The next closes country was Switzerland at 72%, nearly ten points behind.</a></p><p>Somewhat more surprising is that South Koreans\u2019 views of China are even more negative than those they hold regarding more traditionally antagonistic countries <a href=\"https://ceias.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Korean-poll-finaldraft-adjustments-3-1_rqt-1-2.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">like North Korea (69%) and Japan (62%).</a></p><p>These negative perceptions of China shouldn\u2019t necessarily come as a surprise given Beijing\u2019s inflammatory behavior across several domains.</p><p>Domestically, China has instituted mass surveillance and internment against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, quashed democratic movements in Hong Kong, and instituted some of the world\u2019s most draconian measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the foreign policy realm, Beijing has rapidly accelerated its military buildup while constantly threating aggressive force against Taiwan, laid false claim to copious amounts of territory in the South China Sea, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-belt-road-debt-11663961638\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">saddled developing countries with unsustainable debt traps</a>, and can certainly be blamed for the initial outbreak and handling of the aforementioned COVID pandemic.</p><p>And of course, each of these policy decisions has been buttressed by hard-headed bully rhetoric that China refers to as \u201c<a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2020/05/interpreting-chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomacy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wolf Warrior</a>\u201d diplomacy, which until recently dominated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>South Korea is not by any means unique in its disdain for China. A 2020 <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/10/06/unfavorable-views-of-china-reach-historic-highs-in-many-countries/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pew report</a> titled \u201cUnfavorable Views of China Reach Historic Highs in Many Countries\u201d showed that public opinion on China was taking a nose dive nearly everywhere across the developed world. In fact, the median response across the 14 countries surveyed was 73% unfavorable to only 24% favorable.</p><p>What <em>does</em> make South Koreans unique is their particularly harsh view of the Chinese people, specifically. According to a recent <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2022/12/south-koreans-have-the-worlds-most-negative-views-of-china-why/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> from The Diplomat, Europeans and Americans tend to hold separate views of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Chinese people, having generally positive views of the latter.</p><p>However, South Koreans seem to show little differentiation between the Chinese People and the CCP, with 77% of respondents having negative or very negative views of the Chinese populace.</p><p>So, what explains South Korea\u2019s particularly high level of disdain for China? To find out I spoke with four Koreans and asked them the following questions.</p><ul>\n<li>1.What are the biggest factors that have resulted in South Koreans having the world\u2019s most negative views of China?</li>\n<li>2.Why do Koreans not only view the CCP negatively, but also the Chinese people?</li>\n</ul><p>\n\tThe Koreans I interviewed are all college educated and range in age from 20-32, thus their views may not be representative of the entire population. Nonetheless, their answers provide much needed context and narrative to supplement the figures displayed in recent polling. Pseudonyms are used for anonymity purposes, but personal details such as occupation and age are accurately disclosed.\n</p><p>\n\tENVIRONMENT\n</p><p>\n\tThe most prominent answers given for Koreans\u2019 negative views of China were related to pollution and the environment, specifically Yellow Dust.\n</p><p>\n\tWon-bin Kim, a 27-year-old graduate student, noted this as the most pressing issue surrounding South Korea \u2013 China relations. \u201cI can\u2019t generalize the answer, but for me the biggest issue is the environment,\u201d said Mr. Kim. \u201cWhen I was young, Yellow Dust should [sic] come like three to four days at Spring, but now in Korea, it\u2019s hard to find a day without Yellow Dust in the spring.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tYellow dust, or <em>hwangsa </em>in Korean, is a phenomenon where fine dust from the deserts of Northern China and Mongolia is blown by strong winds onto the Korean Peninsula. When the fine dust enters the lungs, it can cause sore throat and other respiratory issues such as trouble breathing. This dust is also capable of bringing with it industrial pollutants such as pesticides.\n</p><p>\n\tIn truth the amount of Yellow Dust in South Korea has fluctuated year to year, with a steady drop in duration occurring between <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1125927/south-korea-yellow-dust-duration/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2015 and 2020</a>. However, 2021 did mark a six-year high with 22 days of Yellow Dust cover.\n</p><p>\n\tSo, is China to blame for this problem? Well yes, and no. While there is a significant amount of the fine matter that does originate in China, studies have shown that large amounts come from within Korea. A <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-air-pollution-in-south-korea-can-teach-the-world-about-misinformation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recent joint study</a> by NASA and the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) showed that at Seoul\u2019s Olympic Park, only 34% of fine dust came from Western China, while 52% came from South Korean factories.\n</p><p>\n\tKoreans don\u2019t see themselves as totally blameless, but they are most angered by China\u2019s inaction and lack of ownership.\n</p><p>\n\t\u201cFine dust pollution is a difficult one since Korea is shitty at addressing it too,\u201d said Joon Kang who is currently serving his mandatory military enlistment. \u201cHowever, China building factories on their eastern coast and not taking any responsibility just angers Koreans even more.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tHISTORY AND CULTURE\n</p><p>\n\tAfter the environment the next most pressing issue was China\u2019s attempted theft of Korea\u2019s history and culture.\n</p><p>\n\tThis was the sentiment expressed by Taeyang Park, a student currently studying in the US at an Ivy League university. \u201cTo be specific, some Chinese historians have claimed that Korean dynasties are actually part of Chinese history,\u201d said Mr. Park. \u201cKoreans view this as tantamount to theft.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tAs part of its Northeast Project, which ran from 2002-2007, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences attempted to retcon historical borders and claim the ancient Korean kingdom of <em>Goguryeo, </em>along with its successor kingdom known as <em>Balhae, </em>as historically being part of China. According to Chinese scholars, these entities were never autonomous, but merely vassals of China.\n</p><p>\n\tMore recently, a 2022 <a href=\"https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220914000584\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exhibit</a> on ancient Korean history at the National Museum of China omitted both <em>Goguryeo</em> and <em>Balhae</em> from its chronological table of contents, further exacerbating the rift between the two nations.\n</p><p>\n\tOutside of China, most historians consider <em>Goguryeo</em> to be part of Korea\u2019s historic entity, and part of the Three Kingdoms period along with <em>Baekje</em> and <em>Silla</em>. <em>Goguryeo</em> occupied small parts of modern South Korea, the entirety of modern North Korea, and part of Manchuria.\n</p><p>\n\tFrom 598-614 <em>Goguryeo</em> fought with Sui China in a series of wars that ended with <em>Goguryeo</em> defeating the Sui Dynasty, leading to its eventual demise. <em>Goguryeo</em> commanders included King Yeongyang, Gang Isik, and Eulji Mundeok. Sui prominent figures included Emperor Yang Guang, Yuwen Shu, and Yu Zhongwen.\n</p><p>\n<img alt=\"Map Description automatically generated\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/feeds/feed.rss\" />\n</p><p>\n\tMr. Park noted the inconsistencies in Koreans extreme disdain at Chinese attempts at claiming Korean history when neighboring Japan is doing the same thing. \u201cAs a Korean citizen, I find this a bit awkward as Japan is basically doing the same thing with Dokdo,\u201d said Mr. Park. \u201cIt would make sense for Koreans to hate Japan more than China, but in reality, sentiments towards China are much more negative.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tMr. Kang, the soldier, explained that China\u2019s appropriation of Korean tradition doesn\u2019t stop at borders either. \u201cChinese people claim that kimchi, the Hanbok, and other Korean cultural icons as [sic] their own even though there is too much historical evidence that it\u2019s clearly Korea\u2019s.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tRecently some in China have even attempted to claim <em>Arirang</em>, one of Korea\u2019s most famous traditional folk songs, belongs to the Chinese people. This prompted the Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK), a non-governmental diplomatic group, to release an <a href=\"https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220717000171\" target=\"_blank\">advertisement</a> with text reading \u201c<em>Arirang this time?! China why again?... Sign the petition to stop Chinese cultural hegemony.\u201d</em>\n</p><p>\n\tOTHER REASONS\n</p><p>\n\tOf course, responses weren\u2019t limited to the environment or cultural theft. There was also widespread anger towards China over the COVID outbreak, as well as Beijing\u2019s response. In fact, all four mentioned COVID but offered little elaboration as though it should be obvious.\n</p><p>\n\tThere was also agreement to the geopolitical threat that China poses, including its military buildup, support of the regime in North Korea, its clandestine spy network, and operating of police stations in foreign countries like South Korea.\n</p><p>\n\tOne topic, however, that wasn\u2019t mentioned was the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or\n</p><p>\n\tTHAAD. After the United States and South Korea agreed to install the missile defense system to defend against North Korean missiles, Beijing became irate claiming the system was a tool that could be used to spy into China. As a result, China levied heavy sanctions on South Korea which caused a major blow its economy.\n</p><p>\n\tTHE CHINESE PEOPLE\n</p><p>\n\tBut what about the people? Remember, unlike their international counterparts, Koreans views of Chinese citizens are nearly as negative as their views on the CCP.\n</p><p>\n\tResponses here were all over the place, but one thing they all had in common was a lack of ambiguity.\n</p><p>\n\tMr. Kim, the graduate student, revealed a few stereotypes that Koreans hold about Chinese citizens, including that they are noisy in public spaces and that they act ignorant and selfish, and that they often have poor hygiene.\n</p><p>\n\tSujin Kwon, an office worker in central South Korea stated that it was \u201ceveryday life\u201d that inspired anti-Chinese sentiment in Korea. \u201cHonestly I believe hatred towards China comes from everyday life,\u201d said Ms. Kwon. For example, \u201cChinese people coming here and take [sic] advantage of Korea\u2019s healthcare system.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tMs. Kwon also referred to Chinese nationals \u201ckilling people in daylight.\u201d When asked to elaborate Ms. Kwon referred me to an <a href=\"https://www.nbntv.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=972076\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">incident</a> from May 2022 where a <em>Joseon-jok</em> man in his 40s assaulted and killed an elderly Korean man. <em>Joseon-jok</em>, though ethnically Korean, migrated to Northeast China during the Japanese occupation and have since returned to Korea. They generally speak Chinese and live in Chinatown enclaves and are thought of in Korea as Chinese.\n</p><p>\n\tThen there is the issue of Chinese students attending Korean Universities.\n</p><p>\n\tIn the words of the soldier, Mr. Kang, \u201cChinese students are a menace to academia. During the Hong Kong protests, any sign of support was faced with aggressive extremist, and sometimes violent opposition by Chinese students. Ripping down posters, shoving students, and overall disrupting the democratic student process.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tContinuing with his answer Mr. Kang revealed that for Koreans, separating the CCP and the Chinese people isn\u2019t necessarily an easy task.\n</p><p>\n\t\u201cOur hate for China stems from the CCP, but the Chinese people support that same cancerous regime,\u201d said Mr. Kang. \u201cObviously not everyone, but the ones who do are the most up front and the loudest. To me, supporting the CCP doesn\u2019t make you and different than being a Chinese agent.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tIn one final diatribe Mr. Kang summed up why China is seen in such a negative light in South Korea, even when compared to Japan which colonized the Korean Peninsula for 35 years, and an antagonistic and now nuclear armed North Korea. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in Korea, Japan is the enemy for 100 years, but China is the enemy for 1,000 years,\u201d Mr. Kang noted. \u201cChina is a growing cancer in the world and poses a legitimate existential threat to the Korean nation, state, and people. It\u2019s no wonder Koreans hate China.\u201d\n</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/big-pharma-director-bananas", "title": "\"I'm Literally a Liar\": Big pharma director goes bananas, attacks journalist and smashes his computer", "date_published": "2023-01-27 15:13:21+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32913493&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>Yesterday, we covered the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pfizer-director-mutatiing\" target=\"_blank\">viral</a> Project Veritas video of  (probably former) <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pfizer-ceo-pill-computer-chip\" target=\"_blank\">Pfizer</a> Director of Research and Development Jordon Trishton Walker.
