## Tesla's volatile Q4 couldn't dampen its record setting year

<p>Between its ongoing supply chain constraints, brutal rounds of layoffs and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-report-layoffs-hiring-freeze-160001808.html">a plummeting stock price</a>, the past year has been a glass case of emotion for Tesla and its embattled CEO, Elon Musk. Still, the company managed to produce nearly 440,000 vehicles and delivered over 405,000 of them — year over year increases of 47 and 40 percent, respectively — Tesla announced on Wednesday during the <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/">Q4 2022 earnings call</a>. Those are both records for Tesla, as was the full-year deliveries of 1.31 million. Profits for the year totaled $12.6 billion.</p><p>"Despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges," Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, said during the call. "It's worth noting that all these records were in the face of massive difficulties. a credit to the team for achieving that."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The final quarter of 2022 was especially volatile for the electric automaker following the finalization of Musk's Twitter acquisition in late October. While the billionaire sought to split his attention between his EV company, his spaceship company and his new social media platform, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdHJlZXQuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGVzbGEtc2hhcmVob2xkZXItZnJ1c3RyYXRpb24tdHVybnMtaW50by1yZXZvbHQtYWdhaW5zdC1lbG9uLW11c2siLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ0YjcwNWJjLTljN2EtNDU2MS05NjRmLTVhZGUxZDlkMWI0MSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbudzZapPJtEyIEisLiAzO1tstJail0QkPW0eba53DyV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Ftechnology%2Ftesla-shareholder-frustration-turns-into-revolt-against-elon-musk">Tesla shareholders revolted</a>, furious that the automaker had lost some $620 billion in market capitalization that year. Musks antics at Twitter combined with his sale of Tesla stock to fund the acquisition sent the EV company's ticker tumbling, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-implements-huge-us-price-cuts-across-its-lineup-083211088.html">resulting in drastic price cuts</a> — by as much as $20,500 in some cases. This, in turn, saw customers in China, angry that they had just purchased their vehicles at a higher price, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-owners-china-protest-against-surprise-price-cuts-they-missed-2023-01-07/">raid Tesla showrooms to demand answers and restitution</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"The most common question we've been getting on investors is about demand," Musk said. "I want to put that concern to rest. Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders here today then ever in our history, we currently are seeing orders at Almost twice the rate of production."</p><p>"It's hard to say whether that will continue at twice the rate of production," he continued. "Orders are high and we've actually raised the Model Y price up a little bit in response to that. We think demand will be good despite, probably, a contraction in the automotive market as a whole."</p><p>Those price cuts will continue into the new year. "In the near term we are accelerating our cost reduction roadmap and driving towards higher production rates," the company announced Wednesday. "In any scenario, we are prepared for short-term uncertainty, while being focused on the long-term potential of autonomy, electrification and energy solutions."</p><p>Musk also discussed recent developments regarding the company's "Full Self-Driving" beta ADAS during the call. "As of now we've deployed FSD beta to... <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fsd-driver-assist-available-to-all-drivers-114916660.html">roughly 400,000 customers in North America</a>," he said. "<a href="https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport">Our published data</a> shows that improvement in safety statistics is very clear. So, we would not have released FSD beta if these safety statistics were not excellent."</p><p>Despite the turbulence, Tesla continues to expand its regional production capacities. In January, the company announced its<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-3-6-billion-expansion-nevada-gigafactory-055246273.html"> $3.6 billion investment in two new factories</a>, one of which will produce the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-finally-delivers-its-first-production-semi-to-pepsi-014214184.html">long-awaited</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delays-the-semi-ev-debut-until-2022-citing-global-chip-shortages-160016735.html">repeatedly-delayed</a> Semi electric 18-wheeler.

## Donald Trump will get his Facebook and Instagram accounts back 'in the coming weeks'

<p>More than two years after Meta extended former President Donald Trump’s “indefinite” suspension from Facebook, the company has opted <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/trump-facebook-instagram-account-suspension/">to reinstate</a> his account. In a statement, Meta said Trump would be able to access his Facebook and Instagram accounts in the “coming weeks,” but that there would be &quot;new guardrails in place to deter repeat offenses.”</p><p>The decision comes after Trump’s campaign had reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-reportedly-asked-meta-to-reinstate-his-facebook-account-181751974.html">pushed</a> for the former president to be allowed back on Facebook ahead of the upcoming presidential primaries.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Trump was originally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-locks-out-trump-24-hours-014550117.html">booted</a> from Facebook in the aftermath of the attack on the US Capitol on January 6th, 2021, after publicly praising the rioters. Meta’s handling of the initial suspension, which it quickly extended from a 24-hour ban to an “indefinite” suspension, was heavily criticized, including by its own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-locks-out-trump-24-hours-014550117.html">Oversight Board.</a> In its decision weighing in on Trump’s suspension, the board slammed Meta for not following its own rules and trying to “avoid its responsibilities.”</p><p>Meta then revisited the  suspension, and said it would last for at least <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-could-be-back-on-facebook-in-time-for-primaries-164200140.html">two years</a>. However, the company confirmed that Trump would eventually be allowed back on Facebook. Nick Clegg, Meta’s top policy official, said at the time the former president would be “subject to new enhanced penalties” for future policy violations.</p><p>Now, Clegg says that Trump and other public figures who have been reinstated following suspensions “related to civil unrest” will face new suspensions, lasting for<a href="https://twitter.com/nickclegg/status/1400852901736509446"> at least a month</a>, for future offenses. He added Meta would also take steps to limit the reach of Trump’s posts if they contribute “to the sort of risk that materialized on January 6th, such as content that delegitimizes an upcoming election or is related to QAnon.” While Meta may not remove those posts entirely, he said the company would consider removing the share button and blocking them from the company’s advertising and recommendations systems.</p><p>Clegg also confirmed that the company's controversial <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html">&quot;newsworthiness&quot;</a> policies could continue to apply to Trump. &quot;In the event that Mr. Trump posts content that violates the letter of the Community Standards but, under our newsworthy content policy, we assess there is a public interest in knowing that Mr. Trump made the statement that outweighs any potential harm, we may similarly opt to restrict the distribution of such posts but leave them visible on Mr. Trump’s account,&quot; Clegg wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta's decision comes just months after Elon Musk also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-donald-trump-unbanned-elon-musk-023043690.html">restored</a> the former president's Twitter account. Trump has so far declined to restart his Twitter habit — he decamped to Truth Social last year — but is reportedly planning to return, according to a recent <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/donald-trump-ditch-truth-social-for-twitter-facebook-1234665307/">report</a> in <em>Rolling Stone. </em>While the former president was known to favor Twitter, his Facebook following was also an important asset to both of his previous campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>Trump's suspension was also the first major test of Meta's Oversight Board, which the company formed to help it weigh in on thorny content moderation and policy decisions. In <a href="https://twitter.com/OversightBoard/status/1618370207776641031">a statement</a> Wednesday, the board said that it had &quot;no role&quot; in the company's decision to reinstate Trump, and that it plans to &quot;publish a fuller analysis of this case in a future quarterly transparency report.&quot;</p>

## 'Redfall' brings open-world vampire hunting to Xbox and PC on May 2nd

<p>It's arriving several months <a href="https://www.engadget.com/redfall-game-trailer-184102203.html">later than expected</a>, but Arkane's next big game is (relatively) close at hand. The studio has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/01/25/redfall-release-date-and-new-gameplay-revealed/">confirmed</a> that <em>Redfall</em> will be available on May 2nd for Xbox Series X/S and Windows PCs, with launch day access through Game Pass. As before, the vampire-slaying shooter is an expansion of the formulas behind <em>Dishonored</em> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-15-prey-2017-hands-on-preview.html"><em>Prey</em></a> — it's a stealth-friendly game built with multiplayer and unpredictability in mind.</p><p>Like other Arkane titles, <em>Redfall</em> hinges on player choice. You can directly fight the vampires taking over the game's namesake town, but you'll also be rewarded if you take the stealthy approach or make clever uses of your gear. The open world concept isn't strictly new (<em>Prey</em> had it), but the choice of characters and online play are. You can choose a hero that reflects your play style, and up to four people can take down the villains in co-op mode. Certain tactics only work when you're playing as a team.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c8457ab96c2f4a1aa944359abd50cba5"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The free-ranging gameplay adds some variety, but you can also expect weapons with randomized stats and customization. Some mechanics will be familiar. You'll find activities beyond the main story missions (such as rescuing survivors), skill trees and other systems that encourage  doing more than the essentials.</p><p>It's too soon to say if <em>Redfall</em> will maintain Arkane's reputation. However, it's evident the developer is happy to build on its better-known gameplay mechanics rather than take some chances like it did with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html"><em>Deathloop</em></a>. If you tried <em>Prey</em> and wished your friends could join in, though, you might be happy.</p>

## DARPA wants AR goggles to help soldiers with complex tasks

<p>DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) is <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-01-25">developing</a> a new system to help military personnel perform complex tasks. Perceptually-enabled Task Guidance (PTG) technology uses sensors to see and hear what the user sees and hears, guiding them through AI-produced instructions displayed in augmented reality (AR).</p><p>PTG combines sensors (a microphone and head-mounted camera) with AI and AR headsets to integrate into the user’s environment. The idea is to help soldiers and other military personnel enhance their skills, complete complicated tasks and perform them better. DARPA has narrowed its focus to three areas: battlefield medicine (like untrained personnel helping medics in the field), sustainment (keeping military equipment up and running) and co-piloting (especially helicopters).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, DARPA’s training demos use something more pedestrian: cooking. Dr. Bruce Draper, the program’s manager, describes it as the ideal proxy task. “[Cooking is] a good example of a complex physical task that can be done in many ways. There are lots of different objects, solids, liquids, things change state, so it’s visually quite complex. There is specialized terminology, there are specialized devices, and there’s a lot of different ways it can be accomplished. So it’s a really good practice domain.” The team views PTG as eventually finding uses in medical training, evaluating the competency of medics and other healthcare services.</p><figure><img alt="First-person view of a person pouring liquid from a plastic jug into a measuring cup.

The reversal came after discovering that the current version caused issues like headaches, eyestrain and nausea.</p><p>DARPA is the Department of Defense’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-07-darpa-explainer.html">“mad science” division</a>. Founded by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1958 to develop cutting-edge tech for the US, many of the agency’s projects have trickled down into non-military products, including GPS, speech recognition, self-driving cars and robotics. Oh, and a minor technology called “the internet” also stemmed from DARPA’s late 1960s ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) program. It’s easy to imagine some form of PTG eventually following their lead into our everyday lives.</p><div id="566f3142a59c46f1bc053f698966fae9"></div><p></p>

<p><em>Forza Motorsport</em>, the eighth mainline entry in Turn 10 Studios' long-running simulation racing series, will arrive later this year, the developer announced during Microsoft and Bethesda's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-xbox-and-bethesdas-developer-direct-showcase-here-at-3pm-et-173244644.html">Developer Direct showcase</a>. The release date technically constitutes something of a delay, as Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/forza-motorsport-spring-2023-release-174340903.html">announced last June</a> it would release the game in the spring of this year. Moreover, if you were hoping to play the game on an Xbox One console, you'll need to turn to the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-180329068.html">Xbox Game Pass service to do so</a>; Microsoft plans to release <em>Forza Motorsport </em>on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox Game Pass and PC via the Microsoft Store and Steam.&nbsp;</p><div id="4f82c753ce3440628fa65992a781f6a7"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>On Wednesday, Turn 10 promised <em>Forza Motorsport </em>would take full advantage of the latest Xbox and PC hardware to deliver the franchise's most immersive racing experience yet. The game will feature more than 500 cars for players to collect, including 100 vehicles that are new to the series. To make those cars look their best, Turn 10 used a spectrophotometer to scan the paint jobs of the cars featured in the game. &quot;With this new sourcing technique, our paint models have a more realistic light response across colors, metal flake and gloss levels,&quot; the studio said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/01/25/forza-motorsport-delivers-a-generational-leap-in-fidelity-immersion-and-realism/">blog post</a> published after the showcase. Each car will now also feature context-aware damage and dirt buildup that Turn 10 says is &quot;authentic and unique&quot; to each vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>During the showcase, the studio showed off Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit in South Africa, one of the five new racing tracks featured in the game. With the help of photogrammetry and laser-scanned images, Team 10 says the environments in <em>Forza Motorsport </em>feature 10 times more realistic detail than past entries in the series. With the addition of dynamic time of day and weather simulation, Turn 10 says fans can expect no two laps around a track to look or play the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Expect Microsoft to share more details about <em>Forza Motorsport</em> later this year.</p>

<p>Here's a pleasant surprise from Xbox and Bethesda's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-xbox-and-bethesdas-developer-direct-showcase-here-at-3pm-et-173244644.html">Developer Direct showcase</a>: a full game you can download (almost) right away. <em>The Evil Within</em> studio Tango Gameworks has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/01/25/hi-fi-rush-reveal-out-now-game-pass/">unveiled</a><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, a combo-driven brawler with rhythm game elements. You play Chai, a would-be rockstar who fights a robotics company with the help of the beat. Think <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-22-devil-may-cry-5-hands-on-interview-dante-you-forget-about-me.html"><em>Devil May Cry</em></a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bayonetta-3-review-130024141.html"><em>Bayonetta</em></a> crossed with a music game, or a very pretty spiritual sequel to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-31-pounding-beats-and-dragons-in-crypt-of-the-necrodancer.html"><em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em></a>. You aren't forced to play to the beat, but you're rewarded for staying in sync with high-powered combo moves and finishers.</p><p>Not surprisingly, style plays an important role. The game revolves around its anime-inspired cel-shaded look, its non-stop humor and a mix of both licensed and original music. Streamers don't have to panic about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-dmca-takedowns-notice-193717690.html">copyright violations</a> — there's an &quot;alternate audio mode&quot; to keep the soundtrack legal during broadcasts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="04bda45187b8454b959cb211a5afa69a"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The title will be available later today for Xbox Series X/S and Windows PCs (through the Epic Games Store, Microsoft Store and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230/HiFi_RUSH/">Steam</a>). It's also available through Game Pass on these platforms. This is a distinct change of pace for Tango, which is better known for dark, moody titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghostwire-tokyo-preview-ps5-2022-150024173.html"><em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em></a>. You might not mind, though, particularly if you're looking for something more upbeat.</p>

Announced last June, the game resembles a modern spin on classic <em>Warcraft</em> strategy: Your goal is to protect your base and destroy your enemy's. It'll feature online campaign co-op and competitive multiplayer, as you'd expect. And judging from the most recent trailer, it looks compelling enough to tempt over gamers who could never figure out what to do in the original <em>Minecraft</em>.</p><div id="044edc6317004463bafff61b109a3ed5"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>

## CNET corrected most of its AI-written articles

<p><em>CNET</em> has issued corrections for over half of the AI-written articles the outlet recently attributed to its CNET Money<em>&nbsp;</em>team. Following an internal audit after it was first notified of an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-reviewing-ai-written-articles-serious-errors-113041405.html"><ins>AI-written article with substantial errors</ins></a>, <em>CNET </em>Editor-in-Chief Connie Guglielmo <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/cnet-is-testing-an-ai-engine-heres-what-weve-learned-mistakes-and-all/"><ins>says</ins></a> the publication identified additional stories that required correction. She claims a “small number” needed “substantial correction,” while others had “minor issues” that saw <em>CNET</em> fix things like incomplete company names and language the outlet deemed was vague. In all, of the 77 articles the publication now says were written as part of a trial to test an “internally designed AI engine,” 41 feature corrections.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/25/23571082/cnet-ai-written-stories-errors-corrections-red-ventures"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em><ins> points out</ins></a>, some <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/banking/how-to-close-bank-account/"><ins>articles</ins></a> feature corrections that note <em>CNET</em> “replaced phrases that were not entirely original.” In those instances, the outlet says its plagiarism checker tool either “wasn’t used properly” by the editor assigned to the story or it failed to identify writing the tool had lifted from another source. Earlier this week, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai"><em><ins>Futurism</ins></em></a>, the publication that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-gets-caught-playing-ai-mad-libs-with-its-financial-news-coverage-001026432.html"><ins>first broke the news</ins></a> that <em>CNET</em> was quietly using AI to write financial literacy articles, said it found extensive evidence the website’s AI-generated content that showed “deep structural and phrasing similarities to articles previously published elsewhere.” Pointing to one piece on <a href="https://archive.is/dX9rr"><ins>overdraft fees</ins></a>, <em>Futurism</em> noted how <em>CNET</em>’s version featured nearly identically phrasing to an earlier article from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/overdraft-fees-vs-nsf-fees/"><em><ins>Forbes Advisor</ins></em></a>. It’s worth noting that AI, as it exists today, can’t be guilty of plagiarism. The software doesn’t know it’s copying something in violation of an ethical rule that humans apply to themselves. If anything, the failure falls on the <em>CNET</em> editors who were supposed to verify the outlet’s AI tool was creating original content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite the public setback, <em>CNET</em> appears set on continuing to use AI tools to write published content. “We've paused and will restart using the AI tool when we feel confident the tool and our editorial processes will prevent both human and AI errors,” Guglielmo said. “In the meantime, expect <em>CNET</em> to continue exploring and testing how AI can be used to help our teams as they go about their work testing, researching and crafting the unbiased advice and fact-based reporting we're known for.”</p>

## Senator Manchin aims to close battery loophole around the $7,500 EV tax credit

<p>Senator Joe Manchin, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has <a href="https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-legislation-halts-ev-tax-credits-until-treasury-issues-guidance-in-line-with-ira">introduced a new bill</a> that squashes a small loophole around the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) $7,500 EV tax credit. The new credits are restricted to cars with final assembly in the US, as well as those with a certain amount of North American battery content (an amount that increases every year). <em>But</em>, the U.S. Treasury has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-release-ev-tax-credit-battery-minerals-component-rule-march-2022-12-19/">delayed its final rules on battery guidance until March</a>, which means EVs with foreign batteries can still receive the full $7,500 in credits until then. Manchin's legislation, dubbed the American Vehicle Security Act (AVSA), would push the battery requirement back to January 1st.</p><p>“It is&nbsp;unacceptable&nbsp;that the U.S. Treasury&nbsp;has failed to issue updated guidance for the 30D electric vehicle tax credits and continues to make the full&nbsp;$7,500 credits available without meeting all of the clear requirements included in the&nbsp;<em>Inflation Reduction Act</em>,&quot; Manchin wrote a statement. &quot;The Treasury Department&nbsp;failed to meet the&nbsp;statutory deadline of December 31, 2022, to&nbsp;release&nbsp;guidance for the 30D credit and have created&nbsp;an opportunity to circumvent stringent supply chain requirements included in the IRA. The IRA is first-and-foremost an energy security bill, and the&nbsp;EV&nbsp;tax credits were designed to grow domestic manufacturing and reduce our reliance on foreign supply chains for the critical minerals needed to produce&nbsp;EV&nbsp;batteries.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If it's passed, the bill would be disappointing news for anyone who rushed out to buy an EV before March (something <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a42373295/buy-electric-car-government-rules-tax-credit/">plenty of car publications </a>were suggesting). As <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2023/01/25/joe-manchin-tax-credit-loophole-bill/?ncid=edlinkusauto00000015"><em>Autoblog</em> notes</a>, the AVSA doesn't touch on the <em>other</em> IRA loophole, which also allows for the full credit for leased cars built outside of the US. But given Manchin's early obstruction to the IRA, as well as his push against lax battery rules, it wouldn't be surprising to see another bill in the works.</p>

<p>More than 280 workers at TCGplayer, a marketplace for trading card games like <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>and <em>Pokémon</em>, are trying to unionize. A supermajority of the workers have filed for a union representation election with the National Labor Relations Board. If their efforts are successful, they'll form the first union at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ebay/"><ins>eBay</ins></a>, which bought TCGplayer in 2022 in a deal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ebay-acquire-tcgplayer-295-million-193137961.html"><ins>worth up to $295 million</ins></a>.</p><p>Employees of several card and tabletop companies have unionized, including Card Kingdom, Bellevue Mox Boarding House, Noble Knight Games and Paizo. The TCGplayer workers are similarly trying to organize with the Communications Workers of America (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/cwa/"><ins>CWA</ins></a>), which has also worked with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/raven-software-activision-blizzard-union-game-workers-alliance-195516977.html"><ins>several</ins></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-union-zenimax-vote-recognize-190529301.html"><ins>video game studios</ins></a> in their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-boston-proletariat-drops-union-petition-202823180.html"><ins>unionization attempts</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We are ready to unlock the full potential we know TCGplayer can have. By forming a union, we are able to support each other, customers, and sellers to create the best TCGplayer for all of us,&quot; Jennifer Bonham, a shipping generalist at TCGplayer, said in a statement. &quot;We are incredibly passionate about our work, but passion can only get us so far. We want to see our collective health and well-being thrive because for many of us, this is the best job we have ever had.&quot;</p><p>The workers are organizing as TCG Union/CWA and are all employed at the company's authentication center in Syracuse, New York.

Moreover, they're demanding inclusive career advancement opportunities; fair and transparent hiring practices; clearly defined job roles and expectations; and the resources and training needed to do their jobs. On top of that, they're asking for a seat at the table, along with &quot;just cause and clear grievance and discipline procedures, applied equally to management.&quot;</p><p>This isn't the first time that the workers have attempted to unionize, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23561476/tcgplayer-union-ebay-cwa-announcement"><em><ins>Polygon</ins></em></a> notes. They tried to do so almost three years ago with the Service Employees International Union. However, just days before the scheduled vote, they withdrew the petition. The eBay acquisition is said to have reignited the unionization drive.</p><p>&quot;We have received notice that a petition is being filed by the Communications Workers of America labor union asking the National Labor Relations Board to conduct a vote on union representation,&quot; a TCGplayer spokesperson told Engadget in a statement. &quot;We have not seen that petition by the National Labor Relations Board, nor have we had the chance to review it. We respect an employee’s right to choose or to decline union representation, and acknowledge this is a big decision. Our commitment to our employees during this time is to ensure they have the information needed to make an informed and confidential choice.&quot;</p><p>Engadget has contacted eBay for comment.</p>

<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has sent a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/nys_oag_letter_to_madison_square_garden_entertainment_corp.pdf">letter</a> to MSG Entertainment, the owner and operator of Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall, asking for information about its use of facial recognition to deny entry to attorneys at firms representing its legal opponents.

The company, led by CEO James Dolan (who also owns the New York Knicks and Rangers), has defended the policy, framing it as an attempt to prevent evidence collection “outside proper litigation discovery channels.” However, lawyers have <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8xNi90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21hZGlzb24tc3F1YXJlLWdhcmRlbi1iYW4tbGF3eWVycy5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTdkOWVjYy0xMjE1LTRiNWUtYjlmYi05NzA5MzMxNWZkNTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcyrIarO3scQPl-Wc1cN8RIaKrQyqVNbehdrDp2dg0p_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F01%2F16%2Ftechnology%2Fmadison-square-garden-ban-lawyers.html">called</a> that rationale “ludicrous,” criticizing the ban as a “transparent effort” to punish attorneys for suing them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has removed at least four lawyers from events at its venues since October — including at Knicks and Rangers games, concerts and Christmas shows.

Anyone with a ticket to an event should not be concerned that they may be wrongfully denied entry based on their appearance, and we’re urging MSG Entertainment to reverse this policy.”</p><figure><img alt="Feb 12, 2020; New York, New York, USA; New York Knicks executive chairman James Dolan watches the game during the first quarter against the Washington Wizards at Madison Square Garden.

## Wearable ultrasound patch could offer real-time heart scans on the go

<p>Ultrasound can provide <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-15-ge-csound-heart-ultrasound.html">detailed images of your heart</a>, but the bulk makes it impractical for continuous scanning — especially outside of the hospital. It might be far more portable in the future, however. Researchers have <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zNDE1ODYtMDIyLTA1NDk4LXojRmlnMSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTRjOWRlNDUtMTRjNS00ZTlkLWJmZGMtMmNjNWI4YTcyYmNjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdhUBRpaLlkTizd0Pk13PQMW8RI3cVtoP5x8Ehn2iTzs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-022-05498-z%23Fig1">developed</a> a wearable ultrasound patch that provides real-time heart imagery, even while you're in motion. It also uses deep learning to automatically calculate ventricle volume and generate performance stats. You'd know your cardiac output at any given moment, for instance.</p><p>The device uses piezoelectric (that is, pressure-powered) transducers to perform deep tissue imaging. Stretchable liquid metal electrodes, meanwhile, ensures the ultrasound imager can stay close to your skin while remaining compact. Past attempts at wearable ultrasound arrays have relied on thin metal films that limits the design's complexity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The technology isn't close to production. Scientists want to continue miniaturizing the system, which still needs to attach to an external processing system through a flexible cable. The team also hopes to improve the spatial resolution through better algorithms, and use a larger AI training dataset that could better reflect the general population.</p><p>Some of the advantages are already clear, mind you. The creators believe the wearable ultrasound could provide continuous metrics for patients with heart disease or in critical care, including outpatients. Remote ultrasound scans have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/butterfly-network-iq-ultrasound-iphone-covid-19-teleguidance-130000281.html">envisioned before</a>, but have frequently relied on wands or other cumbersome gadgets. The tech could also be helpful for athletes hoping to strengthen their hearts and optimize their abilities.</p><p>The concept isn't limited to one organ, either. The designers say their wearable ultrasound system could be generalized for use with the spine, liver and veins. In that light, the tech could provide freedom to many patients and athletes who'd otherwise need to visit clinics or hospitals to share data for their conditions.</p>

## Google is changing how Android works in India in response to landmark antitrust ruling

<p>After a last-ditch attempt to block India’s landmark Android ruling <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/india-antitrust-body-denies-googles-allegation-it-copied-eus-android-order-2023-01-19/"><ins>failed last week</ins></a>, Google has detailed how its mobile operating system will change to accommodate orders from the country’s Competition Commission. In a <a href="https://blog.google/intl/en-in/updates-to-android-and-google-play-in-india/"><ins>blog post</ins></a> spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/25/23570848/google-india-android-antitrust-billing-search-apps"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, Google said it would give Android users in India the option to decide on their device’s default search engine “via a choice screen” that appears when they first set up a new phone or tablet.</p><p>Additionally, starting next month, all apps and games downloaded from the Play Store will support third-party billing options, allowing developers to skirt Google’s fees on in-app purchases. The company will also begin allowing users to uninstall the first-party apps that came with their devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Competition Commission of India (CCI) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-antitrust-fine-india-203910551.html"><ins>fined Google the equivalent of $162 million</ins></a> last October, alleging the company had abused its “dominant position” in search, video and the web to unfairly disadvantage competitors. Besides changing what Indian consumers can expect from Android, the order will reshape the company’s relationship with Android manufacturers. On Wednesday, the company said it would allow OEMs to license individual first-party apps to pre-install on their devices. The company will also update Android’s compatibility requirements to better support forked operating system variants.</p><p>Naturally, Google is not enthusiastic about re-engineering Android to accommodate the CCI’s orders. “Implementation of these changes across the ecosystem will be a complex process and will require significant work at our end and, in many cases, significant efforts from partners, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and developers,” the company said. In the meantime, it plans to “respectfully appeal certain aspects” of the Commission’s decisions. “We take our commitment to comply with local laws and regulations in India seriously,” Google added.</p><p>Google has tried to mollify regulators and avoid this kind of intervention by introducing programs like its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-spotify-play-store-billing-pilot-212245796.html"><ins>User Choice Billing pilot</ins></a>, which allows developers to implement alternative in-app purchasing systems within their apps. At this point, Google could be swimming against the tide. On Tuesday, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.engadget.com/justice-department-sues-google-to-break-up-the-companys-digital-ad-business-190131636.html"><ins>sued the company</ins></a> in a bid to break up its ad tech division.

Xbox and Bethesda are saving that for a standalone show at a later date. However, perhaps there'll be a surprise announcement or two during today's stream.</p><p>The Developer Direct is debuting just at the right time for Microsoft. The company needs to give people more reasons to get excited about the Xbox ecosystem. It just announced that revenue from Xbox content and services <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-q2-fy23-earnings-report-211718819.html">fell by 12 percent last quarter</a>, while Xbox hardware revenue fell by 13 percent — all during a holiday quarter. <em>Redfall </em>is one of the games I'm most looking forward to this year and there are a ton of Forza and Minecraft fans out there, so it'll be worth paying attention to this stream.</p><div id="8f15ebf4e4a44473939df9421582f243"></div><p></p>

New bills in the state <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/HD2071">House</a> and <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/SD1162">Senate</a> would not only pursue collective bargaining rights across companies, as with past measures, but would guarantee a minimum wage, paid sick leave and other benefits. Companies like Uber and Lyft would also have to cover some driver expenses and pour money into the government's unemployment insurance system.</p><p>The new legislation wouldn't decide whether drivers are employees or independent contractors. However, Senate bill co-sponsor Jason Lewis told the <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/01/24/uber-lyft-rideshare-legislation-unions">State House News Service</a> his bill would establish requirements that apply regardless of a driver's status. Previous bills would have tasked workers with negotiating for benefits that are now included, Lewis says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Massachusetts sued Uber and Lyft in 2020 for allegedly misclassifying drivers as contractors and denying protections granted under state labor law. The companies responded with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/massachusets-court-gig-worker-ballot-proposal-rejected-201748443.html">proposed ballot measure</a> that would have offered benefits in return for requiring that drivers be treated as contractors. The state's Supreme Judicial Court rejected that proposal last June.</p><p>We've asked Uber and Lyft for comment. In a statement, the Service Employees International Union (a bill proponent) says the bill &quot;rewrites the rules&quot; and gives condition drivers have sought for over a decade. The Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work, an industry-run organization that opposes the legislation, previously claimed that measures granting employee status don't reflect a &quot;vast majority&quot; of drivers that want to remain contractors. The coalition prefers bills that would bring the anti-employee ballot proposal to the legislature as well as create portable benefit accounts.</p><p>The state has been one of the major battlegrounds for ridesharing work conditions, but it's only one part of a larger fight. Uber and New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nyc-court-blocks-uber-and-lyft-driver-pay-raise-205406394.html">fought over pay raises</a>, while a California law meant to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-california-governor-signs-ab-5-gig-economy-law.html">reclassify many gig economy workers</a> as employees has faced unsuccessful attempts to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-judge-finds-prop-22-unconstitutional-043822868.html">carve out exemptions</a> for companies like Uber and Lyft.</p>

## NBA All-World hands-on: Taking basketball video games back to the streets

<p>Niantic has created some of the most popular augmented reality games like <em>Ingress</em> and <em>Pokémon Go. </em>But this week the company is launching a new title called <em>NBA All-World</em> that might be the best application of its location-based tech to date.</p><p>For people who have played one of Niantic’s previous titles, <em>NBA All-World</em> features a very familiar formula. After installing the free app (available on Android and iOS), you are given a starter player and from there you can use the in-game map to navigate to real-world locations in order to collect items, earn cash or battle other players. The big twist for <em>NBA All-World</em> is that, instead of visiting random points of interest to battle others, you’ll need to visit real-world basketball courts to earn your spot on local leaderboards. And, of course, there’s a roster of big-name ballers like Giannis Antetokounmpo and Paul George to collect.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b6bc56cdfe7f4b549017a4c1b8bb0a60"></div><p>That might not sound like a major change, but it results in some very notable differences in how you play the game. The first is that instead of hanging out on random street corners like you often do while raiding in <em>Pokémon Go</em>, the need to go to local courts makes <em>NBA All-World</em> feel more grounded in reality. That’s important because Niantic says there’s actually very little overlap between people who play its other titles and more traditional sports gamers (just 10 percent according to Niantic senior producer Marcus Matthews). And after years of people playing basketball game series like NBA2K (or my personal favorite <em>NBA Street</em>) at home, Niantic sees All-World as one of the first games that encourages players to get off the couch and go back outside.</p><p>Because you have to physically go to real courts to take part in battles, <em>NBA All-World</em> feels better connected to the basketball community at large. While I didn’t get to try this out myself prior to launch, it’s not a stretch to imagine people going to a park to play All-World only to hop into a real pickup game. Then, when you sub out, you can go back to challenging leaderboards or playing minigames in NBA All-World on your phone while you catch your breath.</p><figure><img alt="Here's a screenshot of a player's profile in NBA-All World" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/f61876a0-9cb7-11ed-9d7b-92f30140766b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Niantic</div></figure><p>As for the game itself, Niantic has also worked to integrate basketball culture into every aspect of the app. This includes partnering with companies like Adidas and Puma (but not Nike just yet) so you can buy virtual clothing or footwear that matches what star ballers wear IRL. Players in game are also modeled after their real-life counterparts, so centers like Domantas Sabonis are better at blocking while smaller guards are faster and better at stealing the ball. And while Niantic is keeping many elements of <em>NBA All-World</em>’s gameplay pretty simplistic (like defense, which is mostly automatic), the ability to move and juke in various directions, step back for a jumper or drive to the basket provides a surprising amount of depth.</p><p>I also really appreciate that because Niantic already has tons of info provided by users from its other AR games, <em>NBA All-World</em> is populated with tons of in-game locations and hot spots, from courts to places like banks and stores where you can grab items, energy and more. And when the game goes live this week on January 24th, gameplay won’t just be restricted to the US as <em>NBA All-World</em> is getting a full global launch, which really speaks to the international nature of the sport.</p><p>However, at this point it’s important to mention that while I think this might be the best use of Niantic’s location-based gaming tech so far, building a new community and playerbase of gamers is a challenge for any developer. This includes some of the company’s previous stumbles, like its ill-fated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-shut-down-january-31-2022-181008602.html">Harry Potter AR game</a> which is slated to go dark later this month, or its Catan spinoff, which was discontinued in 2021 before ever seeing an official release. But for those looking to dive deeper into the basketball community, <em>NBA All-World</em> looks to offer the best blend of real life and AR integration yet.</p>

## ‘Poker Face’ is the millennial ‘Columbo’ riff I’ve been waiting for
 - [https://www.engadget.com/poker-face-season-one-preview-160035861.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/poker-face-season-one-preview-160035861.html?src=rss)

<p><em>Poker Face isn’t the sort of show that can be spoiled, but have a warning anyway.</em></p><p>I always think there’s been a gulf between production-line TV and its prestige brethren, but that the internet helped demarcate its edges. <em>NCIS</em> was the most-watched drama series in the US from 2009 onwards, but you don’t see <em>The Ringer</em> giving an essay-length breakdown to every episode. These days, prestige drama in the peak-TV mold is pored over and chewed around by the internet sausage machine. Everything else is deemed disposable, despite the obvious and sustained success of the stuff most people are <em>actually watching</em> on broadcast networks. There’s a lot of snobbery there, but also I suspect the <em>The Rookie</em> audience isn’t too fussed about reading a 2,000-word breakdown by an underemployed Yale grad about last night’s <em>Nathan Fillion fights crime action</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="623e119215b44d31960aceb095113cea"></div><p><em>Poker Face</em>, then, is an attempt by what I’ll only-slightly-sarcastically call “prestige TV people” into making production-line TV. Like when a stuffy gourmet chef wants to burnish their “down with the kids” credentials by making the sort of dirty burger you can only appreciate at 3am. Interesting then that, despite the fact its co-creator and star are both poster children for Netflix’s revolution, that the show was set up at Peacock. Created by Rian Johnson, fresh from the success of <em>Glass Onion: A Benoit Blanc Mystery</em>, and <em>Russian Doll’s </em>Natasha Lyonne, <em>Poker Face</em> is an unashamed homage to a lost age of TV. Or, you know, <em>lost</em> if you’re not paying attention to whatever CBS is showing on Thursday and Sunday nights.</p><p>Lyonne stars as Charlie Cale, a woman with a troubled past who has developed the miraculous ability to tell when someone is lying. After attempting to use her talent to get rich quickly on a lazy poker tour across the US, she’s caught by a Reno casino magnate. He offers her a hostess job, in exchange for not murdering her to death, making her promise not to use her talent again. When he retires, and his grabby son takes over, he opts to use her talent rather than keep it hidden, embroiling both of them in a murder mystery. Which eventually leads her taking a road trip in her Plymouth Barracuda, solving murders wherever she goes.</p><p>And, certainly, the show has leant into the idea that <em>Poker Face</em> is probably the closest thing we’re going to get to a millennial <em>Columbo</em> remake. Certainly, the creative team haven’t been shy about drawing the parallels between the ‘70s classic (and, uh 80/90s less classic) and this. It uses the same Inverted Detective Story structure, with the lead character absent in the first act while we see how the murder was committed and the attempts to build a watertight alibi. Not to mention the choice to title the show with boldface yellow text, complete with copyright date under the title card, and its overall ethos. You’ve got a streetwise, rough-around-the-edges New Yorker with a knack for solving crimes and a classic car. And, much like in its inspiration, Lyonne is going up against a series of A- and B-list guest stars, since the most famous guest star (or stars) is the one that did the murder.</p><figure><img alt="Image of Natasha Lyonne in aviator sunglasses and a trucker hat, holding her leather jacket over her left shoulder. She is standing outdoors, but the image is sufficiently blown out that you can just about see some foliage behind, and the hint of a house. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/0ec54f10-9bd3-11ed-a05c-cd09f44aca8c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NBC Universal</div></figure><p>The differences are mostly down to packaging, since <em>Columbo</em> was conceived as a series of movies-of-the-month. (Columbo was originally 90 minutes, but many episodes were “supersized” to two full hours, very commonly to their detriment.) <em>Poker Face</em> is set up as an “episodic” case-of-the-week show, with streaming’s runtime freedom meaning that some episodes run between 80 minutes and just 50 minutes, when the plot is slender enough to justify the trim. That’s good, because it rarely feels like any episode overstays its welcome, and they often skip along at a breezy old clip.</p><p>But this efficiency also robs us of one of the highlights that made classic <em>Columbo</em> as it could often be. Watching a short, scrappy, working-class cop square off against higher status opposition was always a delight. And the show would build up to these confrontations, parceling them out along the way toward the eventual denouement. Star Peter Falk was a great, if difficult, actor, and he would often be squaring off against one of his real-life friends, each one a superstar. And they would load each confrontation with depth, nuance and tension as Lt. Columbo sliced apart their “watertight” alibi with a razor blade. Watching Falk against John Cassavetes, Patrick McGoohan, Robert Culp or the amazing <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PXJRQ1NRbnZPeHNFIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhYTQwMWU2ZS0wNTJhLTQxZTYtYjczOC00MGU5MmVhNmI1NjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVODMgq1d9VEmxMHYJ5rSasitoxhW4VBrOt9bciqWlmy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrQCSQnvOxsE">Jack Cassidy</a> was electrifying television. And all of this is cast aside, because Charlie is apparently a human lie detector that knows whenever the guest star lies in her presence. (This is rather unsubtly demonstrated most of the time by Charlie reflexively coughing a naughty word describing male cow poops that we’re no longer allowed to write here.)</p><p>In its place, is the recurring twist (if it can be called that) that Charlie was actually present or somehow involved with the situation leading up to the murder. So while Lyonne is absent for the first act of the show, you then see an abbreviated version of those same events showing how Charlie came to be inveigled with the events (and has an emotional stake in solving the crime). In a way, you’ll start wondering how exactly we’ll see Charlie pop up and which scenes that we just saw was she lurking in the periphery of. It’s an elegant way of tying the character and the murder together without making her a shabby police officer in a beige raincoat.</p><p>But you don’t need to be a <em>Columbo</em> fan to enjoy <em>Poker Face</em>, and the ultimate litmus test was making my aggressively-<em>Columbo</em>-indifferent wife watch the screeners with me. She said that the show was fun, and it gives you the “joy of seeing how Charlie was there all along.” And that, much like another of her favorite detective shows,<em> Jonathan Creek</em>, you can play along at home, looking for the clues that will eventually point Charlie to solving the case. (The show does play fair, too, and gives you the chance to spot a clue that our hero won’t clock for another few minutes.)</p><figure><img alt="Image of Natasha Lyonne looking up and to the right, off camera, in an overexposed image so bright that she's the only thing visible. She is wearing aviator sunglasses and is holding her jacket over her right shoulder. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/a9357110-9bd3-11ed-bd7f-d28971139b35" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NBC Universal</div></figure><p>The benefit of the episodic nature of the series is that you can dip in and out of it as you feel like it. I watched the six (of ten) episodes Peacock made available for review in dribs and drabs, watching one, then taking a day off, then the next, in a way that felt similar to how it’s intended to be seen. The only issue for would-be dippers is that you may not quite understand why, at the end of half the episodes, a character I won’t name pops up to glower at Lyonne. This is something the show has borrowed from older shows, where our hero was always on the move in order to stay out of the clutches of the overarching villain and keep the story going. But you’d be a fool not to at least watch the pilot episode, which was written and directed by Johnson. (The second episode, where he just directs, sags a little as it opts to restate its premise for anyone who decided to watch TV like a psychopath and not just start at the beginning.)</p><p>Tonally, <em>Poker Face </em>is breezy, despite its rough-around-the-edges world, and there’s often one killer joke in every episode. As much as some episodes might draw from a darker palette, none are even close to being described as “heavy.” It’s not afraid to be a little silly, either, but I’d spoil the fun in explaining how or why it is, so you’ll have to discover that bit for yourself. In fact, most of the fun of the show is just in the watching, so I can’t imagine anyone will be racing to write 2,000-word essay-length breakdowns about how each episode unfolded. Just repeat to yourself: It’s just a show, I should really just relax.</p><p><em>Poker Face</em> debuts on Peacock on January 26th, 2023, with the first four episodes streaming at launch. A new episode will debut every following Thursday for the next six weeks.</p>

<p>These days it’s not necessary to go to a giant studio with overpriced, pro-grade gear to record a Grammy-winning record. You can do it right from the comfort of your own bedroom in fact, using tools priced for even the most casual of hobbyists. It's not news that the tools of creation or the avenues for distributing art are accessible to more people than ever. But the cultural institutions that have dominated popular music for so long can no longer ignore the bedroom producer or budding Soundcloud star.</p><p>Maybe you've been inspired to build your own home recording studio. And maybe, you're not quite sure where to start. Well, an audio interface, a good mic and a decent set of headphones will get you pretty far.

He suggests you "spend the money on a good computer and get other gear — such as audio interfaces, mics, headphones, etc. — used or at reasonable price points."</p><p>But, truthfully, you can do quite a lot with whatever computer you have on hand. Joe Pecora, the engineer and producer at Red Room Studio, says your set up "could be as simple as an iPhone/iPad with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-18-garageband-ios-update.html">Garage band</a>." (I know someone who recorded an <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6NSg7rnMynssHpo2QTZT46?si=2L-uYBlJTQiZCNUauDTkxg">entire album</a> this way.) While he agrees that the most important part is your computer, he argues it doesn't have to be super powerful. It doesn't even have to be a desktop. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-21-hip-hop-producer-j-dillas-beat-making-gear-headed-to-smithsonia.html">JDilla</a> famously created many of his beats on a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JldmVyYi5jb20vcC9ib3NzLXNwLTMwMy1kci1zYW1wbGU_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2ZmJlNzRjZS1mODEwLTM0M2YtOTZhNi1iNGZiOGM3OTY1ZWUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXcNNlKYbdNpnDvTvn8Yw5SiUmvytFMtR2VJuBcuoeqL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Freverb.com%2Fp%2Fboss-sp-303-dr-sample%3F">Roland SP303</a>, and you can basically recreate that experience with an iPad and the $4 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-koala-sampler.html">Koala Sampler</a> for iOS.

DeLay says this is a piece of gear often overlooked by beginners. "It's not just for playing keyboard sounds," he explained, "it can be used to write drums and percussion, to control mixes and more. It's the creative interface of music production, and you don't have to play the piano in order to harness its power."</p><p>We've covered plenty of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-04-best-portable-and-affordable-usb-midi-controllers.html">affordable and portable</a> options before.

While a good set of studio monitors will obviously be better than the speakers on your laptop and will result in a better mix, it's too easy to get caught up in what he calls monitor envy. "The reality is that monitors at a $300 price point are going to work just fine in most spaces," he says. Plus, your bedroom probably doesn't have the space to really make the most of large, powerful monitors. So, save your money.</p><p>And if you're just starting out, you're probably better off getting a decent set of headphones. There're tons of amazing and affordable studio quality headphones out there for under $200, like the $179 Beyerdynamic DT990PRO (currently down to just <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwMDExVUI5Q1E_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taGwtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZmYmU3NGNlLWY4MTAtMzQzZi05NmE2LWI0ZmI4Yzc5NjVlZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWi9ZytubOncI0BRdN_jrsuanMXi_-PDUXr1edKctVVc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0011UB9CQ">$179</a> on Amazon).

Headphones can over emphasize bass, while smaller studio monitors can have trouble delivering accurate bass response. So make sure to listen to your track on laptop speakers or in a car to get a sense of how it will sound in the wild.</p><p>And that's really the key — have the patience to develop your skills and make the most of the gear you have. It's really easy to catch a bad case of GAS (gear acquisition syndrome) when you're first starting out — trust me, I know. But there's no need to shell out thousands of dollars for high-end gear to start making music. You don't even need to buy new gear. Pecora suggests the only thing you absolutely should buy new are headphones. And, presumably, that's just because you don't want to be wearing years worth of someone else's sweat on your ears.</p>

## YouTube accused of using return-to-office policies to thwart union organizers

<p>YouTube Music contractors in the Austin area who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-music-content-operations-contractors-union-184653045.html">voted to unionize</a> are accusing their employers of abusing return-to-office policies to stifle labor organizers. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-engineers-have-formed-a-union-121809363.html">Alphabet Workers Union</a> (AWU) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-24/youtube-uses-return-to-office-push-to-undercut-union-group-says?sref=10lNAhZ9">has filed</a> a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleging that YouTube parent Alphabet and staffing firm Cognizant are using an abrupt return-to-office move, due in February, to punish remote workers, many of whom are reportedly pro-union. Some also live outside Austin. Managers have also been sending work to other offices to &quot;chill&quot; union organization efforts in Austin, according to the complaint, while a supervisor purportedly made implicit anti-union threats.</p><p>While the workers are contracted, they claim Alphabet and Cognizant represent a &quot;joint employer.&quot; If so, Alphabet would be responsible for working conditions and have to negotiate if the Austin-area team votes in favor of a union.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We've asked Alphabet and Cognizant for comment. In a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>, a Cognizant spokesperson claims staff were &quot;fully aware&quot; of an eventual return to the office before the petition to unionize, and that it has &quot;repeatedly and consistently&quot; told employees about its return-to-office policy since December 2021. Those contractors who willingly left the Austin area and can't come back to in-person work can also be &quot;considered&quot; for other work at Cognizant, the spokeperson says.</p><p>This isn't the first increase in tension between Alphabet and pro-union contractors. In spring 2022, Washington state Cognizant employees working on Google Maps warned they would go on strike over an allegedly unreasonable return-to-office schedule. Cognizant pushed back the return by 90 days. At Google, meanwhile, many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/thousands-of-google-cafeteria-workers-unionized-during-the-pandemic-200040902.html">cafeteria workers quietly unionized</a> during the pandemic as they sought better conditions.</p><p>The row comes as Alphabet is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-parent-alphabet-is-laying-off-12000-employees-105523115.html">cutting 12,000 jobs</a> worldwide in the wake of rough economic conditions and dropping profits. While that figure only covers direct employees, it reflects pressure to slash employment costs. That, in turn, may set up conflicts with pro-union workers seeking better pay and benefits.</p>

<p>One of the best-loved Nintendo 64 games is coming to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-pricing-animal-crossing-dlc-143755599.html">Switch Online's Expansion Pack</a> this week. Back in September, Nintendo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/goldeneye-007-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-online-play-pokemon-stadium-mario-party-144252339.html">revealed</a> that <em>GoldenEye 007 </em>was coming to the service and now that day is almost upon us. You'll be able to start playing the game on your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nintendo%20switch/">Nintendo Switch</a> starting on January 27th. The game will be available on Xbox on the same date.</p><p>It's unusual to see a licensed game arrive on Nintendo's subscription service, but <em>GoldenEye 007</em> is one that many fans have been looking forward to replaying (or even playing for the first time). It remains to be seen how well Rare's classic first-person shooter will hold up almost 26 years after it debuted on the N64. Hopefully, Rare has improved the janky controls and awful framerate from the original game.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="868772641ec24166a48f9d3f7b38d227"></div><p>There are some new additions to the Switch Online version, though, including a widescreen mode and online multiplayer. So, you won't necessarily need to cram around the same TV to take on your friends in <a href="https://goldeneye.fandom.com/wiki/Slappers_only!">a &quot;slappers only&quot; deathmatch</a>.</p><p>Rare is also bringing a &quot;recreated&quot; version of <em>GoldenEye 007</em> to Xbox consoles <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/01/25/goldeneye-007-xbox-game-pass-release-date/">this Friday</a> with dual analogue stick support, 4K resolution and &quot;a consistent refresh rate.&quot; Oddly, there's no online multiplayer on the Xbox version, though there's still four-player splitscreen support. You'll be able to access it through Xbox Game Pass. If you have a digital copy of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-07-rare-replay-review.html"><em>Rare Replay</em> collection</a>, you can download <em>GoldenEye 007 </em>to your Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S at no extra cost.</p><div id="64cd829df734466b84e1275b1d50d147"></div><p></p>

<p>Honda has big plans for the new year and electrification will play a huge part of that, the company's recently-promoted SVP of Sales, Mamadou Diallo, told reporters on Tuesday. Expect to see a lot more Honda and Acura hybrids on the road this year, ahead of a major EV push come 2024.</p><p>Overall, Honda is officially aiming to move 1.2 million units in 2023, with Acura shooting for 160,000 units, a 20 - 25 percent increase over what they sold in 2022. And although the company managed to maintain a single-digit days' supply of vehicles throughout last year, it enters 2023 with a glut of cars and trucks and a 17-day supply. As such, dealers are going to be looking to move a lot of that inventory before this year's models start arriving so fingers crossed, we could potentially see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-implements-huge-us-price-cuts-across-its-lineup-083211088.html">some Tesla-level price cuts in the near future</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;In 2023, we will see the strategies we've been talking about, including growing sales of light truck models, increasing volume of hybrid-electric models and the start of digital sales at Acura,&quot; Diallo said in a Wednesday press release. &quot;All this leads toward our vision of 100-percent electrified sales by 2040 to fulfill our ultimately goal of zero emissions by 2050.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The ZDX and ZDX Type S will be Acura's first full-EV offerings and serve as the harbingers of the company's new, exclusively online EV sales strategy. Diallo didn't have much additional information regarding how the system would work — such as whether haggling was allowed or how individual vehicle prices would be set — but assured the assembled journalists, &quot;as we get closer to [the ZDX debut], we certainly will be discussing this a little bit more with our dealer body and the press in general. For right now we're still finalizing all those details.&quot; Acura joins <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-ceo-jim-farley-wants-ev-sales-online-no-car-dealerships-232018196.html">Ford</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-will-go-all-electric-by-2030-and-move-all-sales-online-091653396.html">Volvo</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-ev-live-online-showroom-answer-ev-questions-133009953.html">GM</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-will-only-sell-its-id-electric-cars-online-104048481.html">VW</a> in shifting its electrified vehicle sales to the digital marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p>For its part, Honda is planning a significant increase in its hybrid vehicle production in 2023, starting with the newly-redesigned Accord and Accord Hybrid (they'll also be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honda-google-built-in-accord-touring-220752606.html">Honda's first with Google Built-In</a>). The company &quot;will continue to increase hybrid sales through core models as an important step in bridging customers to full electrified vehicles while reducing GHG emissions,&quot; the Wednesday release reads. Honda anticipates a solid half of this year's CR-V and Accord sales to be of the hybrid variety and its efforts bolstered in 2024 with the introduction of a new Civic hybrid. Sales for the all-electric Prologue begin this year with deliveries set for 2024.</p>

<p>In November, millions of Taylor Swift fans logged on to Ticketmaster to grab tickets for her 2023 tour. However, the site crashed, rendering verified users unable to purchase. Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation, explained that while 1.5 million people had signed up as legit customers, over 14 million hit the site when tickets went on sale – many of which were bots.</p><p>Live Nation president and CFO Joe Berchtold <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ticketmaster-live-nation-senate-judiciary-hearing-195504179.html">told the Senate Judiciary Committee</a> on Tuesday that the company &quot;learned valuable lessons&quot; from the Swift debacle.

Nevertheless, NASA says the faster transit times NTP engines can enable could lower the risk to astronauts – they could reduce travel times to Mars by up to a quarter.

<p>Amazon union workers in the UK are <a href="https://www.birminghamworld.uk/read-this/amazon-workers-strike-in-uk-for-first-time-ever-today-gmb-urges-company-to-give-workers-a-pay-rise-4000039">striking for the first time</a> over wages and what they call "severe" working conditions. They've rejected what they say is a "derisory" £0.50 pay raise (62 cents) and are demanding an increase to £15 ($18.48) an hour.&nbsp;</p><p>A 98 percent majority of GMB union workers at Amazon's Coventry fulfillment center voted in favor of the "historic" walkout and announced a strike date of January 25th <a href="https://www.gmb.org.uk/news/amazon-workers-announce-strike-date">earlier this year</a><a href="https://www.gmb.org.uk/news/amazon-workers-announce-strike-date">.</a> Of 1,000 workers at the plant, 300 are unionized and expected to participate in the action.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon told Engadget in a statement that the size of the strike is "only a fraction of 1 percent of our UK employees." It added that pay has increased 29 percent since 2018 and that it made a one-time £500 payment to help workers with inflation. "Employees are also offered comprehensive benefits that are worth thousands more — including private medical insurance, life assurance, subsidized meals and an employee discount, to name a few."</p><p>However, two employees interviewed by the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtNjQzODQyODciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFjY2YxNzYzLWE1Y2EtNDZhMi1hYzZhLWRiNmVkMGY0MmZhOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZOQyXY7KGpzLLftLo7neK24JN6KviSus9TVjTZBDEeg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness-64384287"><em>BBC</em></a> said Amazon's offer last August of a small pay raise to between £10.50 and £11.45 per hour was a "smack in the mouth" considering the company's profits and high inflation.  "These people had worked two years through the pandemic, that had seen Amazon's shares go through the roof, they had seen the profits just become unimaginable," Darren Westwood told the <em>BBC</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>They also decried the company's work culture, saying Amazon's warehouse robots "are treated better than us." Westwood said that employees are monitored constantly and questioned for any idle time lasting a few minutes. He also noted that some employees work 60 hours a week to make ends meet.</p><p>In April of 2022, workers at Amazon's Staten Island warehouse voted to become the first in the US to join a union, and Amazon's appeal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fails-to-overturn-staten-island-warehouse-vote-to-unionize-064010341.html">failed last week</a>. The company recently announced that it would eliminate 18,000 jobs, the majority from its retail and recruiting divisions. It has been frequently been accused of poor working conditions, notably after a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-sued-by-family-of-employee-killed-in-warehouse-tornado-collapse-085656743.html">warehouse collapsed</a> in a tornado, and also faced criticism over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-anti-union-report-election-staten-island-153310661.html">anti-union activities</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 1/25/2023 5:18AM ET</strong>: The post has been updated with Amazon's statement to Engadget.</p>

<p>Multiple Microsoft 365 services went down for thousands of users around the world, prompting the tech giant to investigate the incident affecting several of its products. In an announcement about the outage posted in the early morning (ET time) of January 25th, the company said users were unable to access its services, including Microsoft Teams, Exchange Online, Outlook, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, Microsoft Graph, PowerBi and Microsoft 365 Admin Center. The tech giant admitted that the outage might not be limited to those products, however, and true enough, over a thousand users also reported having problems with accessing Xbox Live on <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/xbox-live/">Down Detector</a>.</p><p>In an update to its announcement, Microsoft said it &quot;isolated the problem to a networking configuration issue.&quot; The company added that it had to plan its next troubleshooting steps carefully and analyze &quot;the best mitigation strategy&quot; in order to come up with a solution that wouldn't cause any additional impact.

## Bowers & Wilkins updated its Pi7 and Pi5 earbuds with better battery life

<p>Bowers &amp; Wilkins <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-wilkins-pi-7-pi-5-premium-true-wireless-earphones-080322096.html">debuted its first true wireless earbuds</a> in the spring of 2021. In fact, it announced two models at that time: the Pi7 and Pi5. Today, the company revealed updated versions for both which will carry the S2 label Bowers &amp; Wilkins typically uses for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2-review-170001854.html">retooled but not entirely brand new products</a>. While the Pi7 S2 and Pi5 S2 aren't rebuilt from the ground up, there are still some notable upgrades to both.</p><p>The Pi7 S2 and Pi5 S2 now both offer five hours of battery life on a charge. That's up from four hours on the Pi7 and Pi5. A 15-minute quick-charge feature still gives you two hours of use and the included cases carry an additional 16 hours for the Pi7 S2 and 19 hours for the Pi5 S2. Both still have wireless charging capabilities, though the case for the Pi7 S2 is equipped with Wireless Audio Retransmission. Like it did for the Pi7, the case can connect to can external audio source — like in-flight entertainment — and wirelessly send sound to the earbuds. This isn't novel to Bowers &amp; Wilkins earbuds, but it is a handy feature nonetheless. Bowers &amp; Wilkins says it also updated the antenna design on the Pi7 and Pi5 to increase Bluetooth range up to 25 meters.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The key difference between the two models is audio quality. The Pi7 S2 supports aptX Adaptive with 24-bit/48kHz streaming from compatible devices and services. 9.2mm balanced armature dynamic drivers are paired with Bowers &amp; Wilkins' digital signal processing tech for higher quality audio that what the Pi5 offers with CD-quality sound and regular aptX. The Pi7 S2 also packs one additional microphone per earbud which should make it the preferred option for calls. And while both feature active noise cancellation (ANC), the Pi7 S2 has an adaptive setup that automatically monitors your surroundings to adjust the audio as needed for &quot;the best possible, uninterrupted listening experience.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Both the Pi7 S2 and Pi5 S2 are available starting today, replacing the Pi7 and Pi5. The $399 Pi7 S2 comes in black, white and dark blue color options while the $299 Pi5 S2 offers light grey, dark grey and purple. A green version of the Pi5 S2 is slated to arrive later this spring.</p><figure><img alt="Bowers &amp; Wilkins Pi5 S2" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/a5f77620-9c6d-11ed-bdec-fd28e09053d7" /><figcaption>Pi5 S2</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bowers &amp; Wilkins</div></figure><p></p>

<p>Tesla has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3Rlc2xhLWV5ZXMtMy02LWJpbGxpb24tZmFjdG9yeS1leHBhbnNpb24tMTE2NzQ2MDQ5ODI_bW9kPXJzc19UZWNobm9sb2d5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2OTZhYzUyOC00NmNhLTQxYzEtYWM4Yi00ZGQ1YjU5NWQyNDYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQNJnju_CZUqJ4SjtJG3AcZ_pBzr9zpar9jt1fZIHDVg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Ftesla-eyes-3-6-billion-factory-expansion-11674604982%3Fmod%3Drss_Technology">big expansion plans</a> for its first Gigafactory near Reno, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-mask-requirement-nevada-battery-factory-210035322.html">Nevada</a>. The automaker has <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/continuing-our-investment-nevada">announced</a> that it's investing $3.6 billion to build two new factories in the complex and hire 3,000 additional workers. That's bigger than the company's initial investment ($3.5 billion) when it made a commitment to build the facility back in 2014. One of the new Nevada factories will manufacture its 4680-type batteries, while the other will be Tesla's first factory to mass produce the Semi.&nbsp;</p><p>The automaker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-finally-delivers-its-first-production-semi-to-pepsi-014214184.html">delivered its first production Semis</a> to Pepsi in December 2022, five years after it first showed off the electric rig and following several delays. Tesla currently manufactures the truck in limited quantities only, but it has long been planning to start volume production in Nevada. The company's Semi truck uses less than 2 kWh per mile of energy and can go between 300 and 500 miles on a single charge. Tesla claims owners will enjoy an estimated fuel savings of up to $200,000 within the first three years.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the Semi factory will finally allow Tesla to mass produce its trucks, its 4680 battery factory will help it achieve its goals of slashing battery costs by half and ramping up production to be able to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-bold-goal-selling-20-mln-evs-could-cost-tesla-billions-2022-08-30/">sell 20 million electric vehicles</a> by 2030. Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-battery-day-25k-ev-231307638.html">introduced</a> the 4680 battery — named as such because its cells measure 46mm by 80mm — as a higher-capacity-but-cheaper option to power its vehicles. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/tesla-invest-over-36-bln-nevada-build-two-new-factories-2023-01-24/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, though, the company has been having issues scaling up its production due to the dry-coating technique used to coat its cells. Tesla didn't say how it's addressing those issues, but it did say that the new factory will have the capacity to produce enough 4680 batteries for 1.5 million light duty vehicles every year.</p>
