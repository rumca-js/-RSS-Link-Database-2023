<p dir="ltr">February is right around the corner, and a new month means a whole bunch of new content coming to HBO Max. Some of that content will be available on February 1, while other shows and movies will be available a little later next month.</p><p dir="ltr">On February 8, Aqua Teen Forever: Plantasm comes to HBO Max. The 2022 movie follows the iconic trio (sorry, Carl) of Adult Swim characters on a new adventure as they split up and then get back together to fight the monolithic corporation, Amazin, led by tech mogul, Neil (voiced by Peter Serafinowicz) and his trusty scientist sidekick, Elmer (Paul Walter Hauser). Check out the trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Harley Quinn: A Very Problematic Valentine's Day Special comes to HBO Max on February 9. Harley Quinn Season 3 was all about Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy navigating the early stages of a relationship when both brought so much baggage with them. A synopsis for the special reads: "As Harley goes to obsessive lengths to ensure that her first Valentine's Day with Ivy is the best ever, Bane's efforts to impress an unexpected date go horribly awry. Meanwhile, after an unfortunate online dating encounter, Clayface engages in some self-love." The special will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/harley-quinn-review-this-dc-universe-cartoon-is-vu/1900-6417371/">play fast and loose with DC Canon</a>, so if you're in the mood for love and to not take it too seriously, the Valentine's Day one-off should be a good change of pace.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-hbo-max-in-february-2023-aqua-teen-forever-plantasm-harley-quinn-valentines-day-special-and-more/1100-6510871/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom Goes All In On Cosmic Horror For Its 2023 Chapter

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>: Necrom is the next chapter of ZeniMax Online's MMORPG, and will introduce a new class, reimagined locations that are bound to be exciting for Elder Scrolls lore-heads, multiple ancient mysteries to unravel, and tentacles. Lots and lots of tentacles.</p><p dir="ltr">As revealed in the recent Xbox and Bethesda developer direct, Necrom will arrive June 5, 2023 on PC and Mac (or for those on consoles, June 20) and bring players back to Morrowind--specifically the eastern, coastal region known as the Telvanni Peninsula that is home to the ancient dark elf city from which the chapter draws its name. Since Necrom was last seen in 1994's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-arena/">The Elder Scrolls: Arena</a>, the first game in the series, the new expansion gives ZeniMax Online an opportunity to update and expand upon the city of the dead for modern audiences. It also presented an opportunity to revisit the fan-favorite region of Morrowind, a place that ESO creative director Rich Lambert said the development team has a particular affinity towards and one that the team previously dove deep on for the game's 2017 Morrowind chapter.</p><p dir="ltr">"Obviously we are not going to go back and recreate one-for-one what was there in Arena," Lambert said. "Things have changed a lot since then, and the overall fidelity of things wouldn't work if we did it that way. But we wanted to capture that essence. We did lots of lore delving, really digging into what the city was about, its history, why it was so important. And then taking a lot of the descriptors from the lore books and interpreting that in a way that was believable and realistic but also lends itself to the legends. In one of the legends, Necrom was built on the bones of this giant beast that Vivec killed. When you advance to the city you see these tall spires, rock-like structures. If you look at it you could interpret it as the ribs of a giant creature. And then you want to dig in…We really leaned heavily on that kind of stuff when we were going in designing the city and also the surrounding spaces."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-necrom-goes-all-in-on-cosmic-horror-for-its-2023-chapter/1100-6510805/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## PS5 DualSense Edge Review - Go Pro

<p dir="ltr">With the DualSense Edge, Sony is the last of the big three platform holders to bring a pro controller to the market. Nintendo has one for Switch, Xbox's Elites are in their second iteration, and both of these exist alongside a plethora of third-party devices from Astro, Turtle Beach, and Scuf, among others. PlayStation's offering arrives in a packed marketplace, but the years of sitting on the sidelines may have worked to Sony's advantage.</p><p dir="ltr">The DualSense Edge incorporates years of learnings from its competitors to present something that ticks all the right boxes for a good high-end video game controller and even improves the user experience in some key ways. The end result is a pro controller that is iterative, but also looks and feels premium while bringing a customizability to the PlayStation gaming experience that hasn't existed before. The question is whether that is enough to justify the $200 price tag for you, and whether its limited battery life will suffice for your needs.</p><p dir="ltr">At first blush, there's not a lot that distinguishes the Edge from the standard DualSense visually. From certain angles, it looks like the same controller, and so very easily fits into the PlayStation 5's white-on-black with blue light trimming aesthetic. If you're not a fan of that, there's little you can do about it short of getting a skin.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-edge-review-go-pro/1100-6510867/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Video game leaks are nothing new, but they occasionally produce cut content or developmental tools that are of interest to enthusiasts. Now, a YouTuber has apparently restored an "abridged" version of Half-Life 1's campaign that was created by Valve during the game's original development.</p><p dir="ltr">The maps that make up this mini-campaign were first discovered in a leak back in the early 2000s, but modders didn't have the raw files required to restore them to full playability. The recent Valve "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/2023-tf2-source-engine-asset-leak">gigaleak</a>" apparently included those files, which led leaker and YouTuber Tyler McVicker to fix the files and post a playthrough to his channel.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">As described above, the campaign is indeed many of the most memorable parts of Half-Life distilled to a half-hour of gameplay, including the survival-horror of its early hours, gunfights with Marines, the tail end of the famous "Surface Tension" sequence, and ending at the flooded Lambda labs.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youtuber-seemingly-restores-abridged-half-life-1-campaign-from-valve-leak/1100-6510866/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Minecraft Legends looks to deviate heavily from the original game's formula with a focus on strategy, and Mojang showed it off at the first Xbox Developer Direct on January 23. The presentation gave us a look at the competitive multiplayer mode, and as you can see, you'll be battling instead of building (mostly) in Minecraft Legends.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft-legends/">Minecraft Legends</a> will allow you to form alliances with returning Minecraft creatures as well as new ones. The cross-play multiplayer experience, which was made in conjunction with Blackbird Interactive, forces you to share your army and resources with the rest of the team. This means cooperation is key to winning, as everyone trying to do the same thing will end in failure. Just like in the campaign (and the original Minecraft), the map is procedurally generated, resulting in a different experience every time you play. Piglins will also be there to attack both teams, so you can't focus entirely on the other team.</p><div>          </div><p>There is plenty of building to be done in Minecraft Legends, too. With the enemy planning an attack on your base, it's up to you to stack your defensives and make something as formidable as possible. This includes walls, gates, towers, and an upgrade station. It's up to you how to draw it up, and you can also place traps to slow down unsuspecting players who manage to get inside.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-legends-and-its-massive-multiplayer-sieges-release-in-april/1100-6510780/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Anna Sorokin, who was convicted of swindling Manhattan's elite as the high-flying Anna Delvey, has signed a deal landing her own unscripted reality-TV series while under house arrest, Delvey's Dinner Club. <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/anna-delvey-sorokin-reality-show-house-arrest-1235501361/">Variety</a> was the first to report about the series coming from Food Network president Courtney White's Butternut production company.</p><p dir="ltr">"She'll do it through what's already become one of the hottest tables in town--invitation-only, intimate dinners at her home," reads a press release from Butternut. "There, a Delvey-invited group of actors, musicians, founders, socialites, journalists and other esteemed guests will join her each week around a private-chef catered table replete with candid conversations where no topic is off-limits--including Anna’s experience within the criminal justice system, her strategy to rebuild her image, and her plans for the future"</p><p dir="ltr">Sorokin was convicted of grand larceny in 2019, plus a host of other financial crimes, for stealing more than $200,000 from investors and friends. Her wild ascent posing as a fake German heiress and her similarly spectacular fall to prison was dramatized in Netflix's Inventing Anna--which introduced the story to the nation, and also inspired parody sketches on Saturday Night Live. Produced by Shonda Rhimes, the series stars Julia Garner (Ozark) as Sorokin, and Anna Chlumsky (They/Them, The End of the Tour) as Vivian Kent, a journalist covering her improbable but very real story.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-con-anna-sorokin-gets-reality-show-deal-inside-her-apartment-during-house-arrest/1100-6510863/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After finding huge success with the low-budget horror movie Barbarian in 2022, director Zach Cregger has sold his next movie and the first details about it have come to light.</p><p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/barbarian-director-zach-creggers-weapons-1235308587/">According to The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the film is called Weapons. Although plot details are under wraps, the site reported that it will be an "interrelated, multistory horror epic" similar in tone to the 1999 Paul Thomas Anderson movie Magnolia.</p><p>According to the report, Cregger's representation took the script to market on the morning of January 22, and a "brief but intense" bidding war came to bear and wrapped up in under 24 hours. New Line ended up securing the rights to Weapons, paying Cregger a fee in the range of eight figures ($10 million-$99 million) to write and direct, the site's sources said. That fee is more than double the budget of Barbarian ($4.5 million).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/barbarian-directors-next-movie-revealed-described-as-multistory-horror-epic/1100-6510862/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Humans and orcs have long been at the center of World of Warcraft, and come Dragonflight's next content patch, players will finally be able to sport unique armor sets invoking the long history of both races in Azeroth.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 10.0.7 will introduce the new Heritage Armor cosmetic sets, something that is already available for many of the game's playable races but has curiously been a long time coming for orcs and humans. Presumably unlocking the set will work similarly to Heritage Armor sets in the past, with players needing to reach exalted reputation with the respective racial faction in order unlock a short quest chain that will ultimately reward the armor set.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">First Look:<br />Orcs + Humans Heritage Armor - coming with 10.0.7 <a href="https://t.co/LOpEoLbNrC">pic.twitter.com/LOpEoLbNrC</a></p>  — World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1618309083047792643?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">January 25, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The human set looks to take inspiration from the armor of fallen Alliance king Varian Wrynn, with a large shoulder piece depicting an eagle (or maybe a gryphon).

<p>Streaming platform Twitch has revealed its 2023 features roadmap, which includes changes to pre-roll adverts, new chat engagement tools, and more options to help users better manage their brand deals. Changing pre-roll ads to be less annoying is easily one of the biggest changes on the horizon, provided that Twitch members can commit to running three minutes of ads every hour, according to chief product officer Tom Verrilli and chief monetization officer Mike Minton.</p><p>"Running three minutes of ads per hour in any way will disable all pre-rolls--they no longer have to be split into 90-second ads every 30 minutes," Verrilli and Minto explained in an <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2023/01/25/2023-an-open-letter-from-our-chief-product-officer-and-chief-monetization-officer/?utm_referrer=https://t.co/ESlzeGbBdL">open letter</a>. "We’re applying our Picture-by-Picture experience to the majority of pre-rolls that viewers do see."</p><p>For mid-roll ads, Twitch is also experimenting with tools to let users know that the stream they're watching is about to take an ad break. Verrilli and Minton explained that Twitch might even add a snooze option for these promotions. For streamers looking to make their sponsorship deals stand out, Twitch is also working on special assets that will be field-tested by a select few streamers first, in an effort to make these deals feel more "effective and authentic" on the platform.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitch-is-improving-pre-roll-ads-analytics-and-more/1100-6510851/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, the next game in the long-running farming sim series, finally has a release date: June 27, 2023. The trailer announcing the date shows off the series' modern artstyle in a striking papercraft trailer that reflects the game's main conceit of following your character's life from beginning to end. </p><p dir="ltr">The trailer's animation is achieved thanks to a pair of hands pulling tabs on an intricate series of paper images. The effect is unlike anything you'll see in a traditional video game trailer, and it suits the bucolic and nostalgic tone of the Story of Seasons series. Unlike previous entries in the series, A Wonderful Life sees the player age as the years pass, and their children grow into adulthood.</p><p dir="ltr">This new version of A Wonderful Life is a remake of the early 2000's GameCube and PlayStation 2 Harvest Moon game of the same subtitle. The Story of Seasons series was published under the name Harvest Moon in English-speaking territories until 2014, when former publisher Natsume began to create its own series of Harvest Moon games. A Wonderful Life is widely considered to be one of the best entries in the series, along with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/harvest-moon-friends-of-mineral-town/">Friends of Mineral Town</a>, which was remade under the Story of Seasons name back in 2021.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/story-of-seasons-a-wonderful-life-gets-june-release-date-in-charming-trailer/1100-6510850/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
