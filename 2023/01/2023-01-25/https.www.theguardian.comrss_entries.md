<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> Brandon Cronenberg continues following in his father David’s footsteps with a violent eye-opener about extreme hedonism</p><p>During the darkest days of the pandemic, there was a universal hankering for escape, from the grimness of the unendingly awful news and also from our homes, another country suddenly seeming more like another world. When stringent protocols had a financial and logistical impact on production, stories that took place in relatively remote locations with relatively small casts started to propagate. But what’s interesting about so many of them, from The Menu to Glass Onion to Triangle of Sadness to Fall to The White Lotus and now to Infinity Pool, is that the majority end up warping our desire to get away, cautionary tales of death and danger imploring us to stay home in order to survive.</p><p>Brandon Cronenberg’s thriller of lurid, and at times laughable, extremities takes us to a swish resort in the fictional state of Li Tolqa, an isolated idyll that lures writer James (Alexander Skarsgård) with his wife Em (Cleopatra Coleman). His last book was six years ago and he’s hoping to be inspired by the new surroundings. Instead inspiration comes from flirtatious actor Gabi (Mia Goth) and her architect husband Alban (Jalil Lespert) who take James under their wing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/25/infinity-pool-review-sundance-film-festival">Continue reading...</a>

## Drift review – beautiful yet undercooked character study

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> Cynthia Erivo stars as a west African migrant who befriends Alia Shawkat’s American émigré in this too-quiet character drama</p><p>Save for its few flashback moments of horrific, haunting trauma, Drift, the mostly quiet story of a west African migrant reeling from the unimaginable on a Greek resort isle, is easy on the eyes. Director Anthony Chen’s film, from a screenplay by Susanne Farrell and Alexander Maksik, gives harried aftermath the sheen of tranquil nobility, resilience hiding in plain sight – the crowd of barely clothed, languid white bodies dotting star Cynthia Erivo’s opening walk down the beach, the bleached yellow of the Mediterranean sun, the way Erivo’s Jacqueline slowly, carefully washes her one set of clothes. Even Jacqueline’s night ritual, arranging plastic bags of pebbles for a makeshift beach cave mattress, takes on the lulling rhythm of a reverie.</p><p>It’s a lot of compelling aesthetic, anchored at most turns by Erivo’s committed, tense performance, that like many a Sundance movie can only cover so much undercooked structure. Drift, based on Maksik’s 2013 novel A Marker to Measure Drift, relies on Jacqueline’s trauma-fragmented memory to unfold the story too slowly. For the first half hour, Jacqueline is mostly a cipher, scrounging for money via beachside foot massages by day, flitting through shadows and dodging bigoted police by night. We catch tantalizing snippets of her clearly suppressed past in too-short flashbacks – a time when she had long braids and a white British girlfriend (Honor Swinton Byrne), a time when she lived in England, a joyful moment with her privileged minister’s family in militarized Liberia. The script’s spareness – what year is it? How did Jacqueline get here? Why is she so alone? – provokes equal parts mystery and frustration.</p><p>Drift premiered at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/25/drift-movie-review-anthony-chen-sundance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Double Australian Open champion is back in the last four and ‘finally over’ controversy of 2013 final against Sloane Stephens</p><p>“Do you know what happened 10 years ago?” says Victoria Azarenka. It is hard to read her emotions because of the sunglasses she wears at her press conference, but her voice is laced with long-held contempt. Assumptions were made about what occurred at Melbourne Park in 2013 when the 23-year-old Azarenka, having just squandered five match points in her semi-final against Sloane Stephens, took a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/24/victoria-azarenka-timeout-australian-open">lengthy, controversial medical timeout</a> before winning the match and then defending <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/28/victoria-azarenka-wins-australian-open">her 2012 title</a>.</p><p>But a decade on, in the context of her references to anxiety and panic attacks fuelled by – among other things – an intense fear of failure, there is a sense the reality may be more nuanced. That Azarenka was, as she put it, painted as the “villain” in the Hollywood narrative that accompanies so many sports. “But we’re not villains, we’re not heroes – we are regular human beings that go through so many, many things,” she says, adding that she sympathises with Novak Djokovic over external doubts about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/23/novak-djokovic-winning-look-alex-de-minaur-australian-open-tennis">his hamstring injury</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/25/tennis-victoria-azarenka-australian-open-semi-final-elena-rybakina">Continue reading...</a>

## Beyoncé’s Dubai performance isn’t just an affront to LGBTQ+ fans, but workers’ rights in the UAE

<p>Arguments focusing on the low application of the UAE’s anti-gay laws overlook the privilege it takes to evade them – and the reality of the labour that builds Dubai’s luxury playground</p><p>It’s not a Beyoncé comeback if it doesn’t “cause all this conversation”, and the musician’s first concert in more than four years has been no exception. Over the weekend, Beyoncé was paid a reported $24m to perform at the unofficial opening of luxury Dubai hotel Atlantis the Royal, in front of an invitation-only audience of celebrities, influencers and journalists. But this choice of location for Beyoncé’s return to live performance – her first since the release of last year’s widely acclaimed Renaissance, although none of the album’s tracks were on the set list – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/22/beyonce-makes-controversial-live-return-at-exclusive-dubai-concert">has proved divisive</a>.</p><p>Fans may well feel disappointed to see Beyoncé prioritise a private performance in Dubai for largely wealthy attenders, including Ronan Keating and Michelle Keegan of all people, given that she’s yet to release videos for the album, let alone announce the long-anticipated Renaissance tour – for which ticket prices are expected to be eye-watering. But the majority of online criticism has been driven by UAE’s laws criminalising homosexuality and gender reassignment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/25/beyonces-dubai-performance-isnt-just-an-affront-to-lgbtq-fans-but-workers-rights-in-the-uae">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Even in dry January, many pubs do little to attract non-drinkers. Shouldn’t they be making a song and dance about their 0% beers and gins?</p><p>It’s a tough time for pubs. Their costs are high and their drinkers are skint. January was always a slow month, long <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/19/the-99-sober-movement-should-we-keep-dry-january-going-all-year">before dry January was a thing</a>. But if necessity is the mother of invention you’d think they would be busting their guts to entice in all the non-drinkers. Where are the pavement advertising boards chalked up with alcohol-free come-on-in offerings? Something like: “Draught alcohol-free beer in here” or: “We have enough zero gins to knock you clean out if they were the real thing.” Or, more radically: “Not drinking? Come on in and we’ll show you it’s possible to have a good time anyway.” OK, I’ll never earn a living as a copywriter, but you get my drift.</p><p>I say this out of love for pubs. Across the UK there are communities where, of an evening, the pub is the only place where people can commune. Yes, pubs aren’t for everyone, but to flourish they need to be. And a bit of come hither to non-drinkers, especially at this time of year, seems an obvious move.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/25/im-not-one-for-conspiracy-theories-but-why-do-pubs-hide-their-low-alcohol-options">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I was inspired by a scene from The Postman Always Rings Twice that is explained only by sound – the clatter of keys falling to the ground, the noise of a lipstick rolling’</p><p>I’ve always been attracted to the theatre and cinema. When I was young, my ambition was to be an actor – and in my teens, I had fun making costumes and sets with my friends. We’d experiment with light, trying to copy our favourite films, such as Sunset Boulevard and Tobacco Road.</p><p>I moved to Rome in search of a break in the film industry. I’d take photos of the starlets from the Cinecittà film studio to earn a living, developing the film myself in the boarding house I was staying in. Ultimately, it was photography rather than acting that I pursued, but aspects of my first great interest – such as film noir and the dreamlike vision of Fellini – influenced my work. I’ve always looked at who I had in front of my camera with a cinematic eye.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/25/model-spills-handbag-gian-paolo-barbieris-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

But I wasn’t prepared to see my daughter’s old trike in the charity shop window</p><p>I saw the wooden trike in a charity shop window, sometime around 2017: it was a bit like seeing a once-beloved ex on a dating website. You didn’t necessarily want them, but you didn’t want anyone else to snap them up either. The trike had belonged to my daughter, and I was in the throes of decluttering my house – throwing other people’s things out, I had found, was easier than my own. I bought the trike back, and for weeks I staked out the other charity shops that had been given my castoffs in the hope I could reclaim books, jumpers, a small colander … Some came back to me, but most didn’t.</p><p>Like many people, I read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/17/she-dropped-three-cheese-and-onion-crisps-and-a-tooth-into-my-hand-what-happened-when-marie-kondo-tidied-my-home">Marie Kondo</a>’s bestselling book <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-9781785040443">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying</a>, and embraced radical decluttering as a way to improve myself. I threw out decades of detritus – payslips saved from my first job, CDs, reams of old magazines. About half went unmissed, but the rest has been largely regretted, including clothes, books and many random items I turned out to be quite sentimental about. The books I kept, which now fit on one bookshelf, are all impressive, truly self-improving works that everyone should probably read. I’ve still not read them and almost certainly never will. That bookshelf reminds me of my failure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/25/the-one-change-that-didnt-work-my-radical-decluttering-turned-into-terrible-regret">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, piled pressure on Rishi Sunak, criticising the prime minister over his handling of outstanding questions around Nadhim Zahawi’s taxes. Speaking at PMQs, Starmer said Sunak’s failure to sack the former chancellor showed 'how hopelessly weak he is'. Starmer also took a swipe at the prime minister's wife, linking his reluctance to take action against Zahawi to tax avoidance in his own family. Starmer said: 'We all know why the prime minister was reluctant to ask his party chair questions about family finances and tax avoidance.'</p><p>Sunak told MPs that he was committed to due process and an investigation into Zahawi's taxes was under way, accusing the Labour leader of 'political opportunism'.

<p>Middle East editor of the Guardian, author and academic who embodied the journalist’s duty to show fairness to all sides</p><p>News of the death of Ian Black, at the age of 69 from a rare brain disease, brought a pair of emails within minutes of each other: one from a Jew with strong ties to Israel, the other from a distinguished Palestinian analyst and sometime peace negotiator. Both expressed the same combination of affection and admiration for a journalist who, in a long, accomplished career, much of it spent covering perhaps the most vexed conflict in the world, somehow managed to retain the respect of both sides. Even if they rarely agreed on much else, they found common ground on this: when it came to coverage of the Middle East, you could trust Ian Black.</p><p>Even as a presence in the Guardian newsroom, where he held the posts of diplomatic editor and Europe editor as well as Middle East editor, he embodied the correspondent’s duty to show fairness to both parties.

<p>My name was floated as a potential head of the social media platform. Here’s what I’d do if I were suddenly in charge</p><p>Elon Musk and I aren’t exactly old friends, but we do go back quite a few years – to early 2013 when I was the public editor (a kind of ombudswoman) at the New York Times. The Tesla head honcho was harshly accusing the paper of sabotage after its review of some new ultra-fast charging stations. The Times review featured a devastating photograph of the cherry-red Model S on a flatbed truck after it reportedly ran out of juice on the last leg of the road trip. My investigation determined that the Times did nothing unethical, though I found some of the reviewer’s methods less than ideal. I don’t think either Musk or the Times was particularly thrilled with my findings.</p><p>Now, a decade later, Musk and I could be ready for a new adventure – an even more contentious one. The tech-news website CNET recently suggested me as a potential chief executive for Twitter, the global social media platform which Musk has been busy running into the ground after buying it for a stunning $44bn last fall. The company has lost about half of its top advertisers since Musk took over, and stands to lose 30 million users over the next two years, according to various estimates.</p><p>Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/25/how-i-would-fix-twitter-if-i-were-ceo-margaret-sullivan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New distilleries are popping up, while old ones are reopening and modernising; some vintages fetch £10,000 a bottle. It’s a new golden age for scotch</p><p>On the eighth floor of the <a href="https://www.leithdistillery.com/">Port of Leith distillery</a>, the latest chapter of the boom-and-bust story of Scottish whisky is under construction. This week, lifts are being installed in what will soon be the UK’s only vertical whisky distillery. The copper stills were supposed to have arrived from Elgin but this is a team as accustomed to delays as whisky distillers are to waiting for their spirit to mature. “No one has built a building like this before,” says Port of Leith co-owner Ian Stirling.</p><p><br />If you’re looking for a symbol of the rise of the Scottish whisky industry, this bold black column soaring 40 metres into the skies over north Edinburgh’s historic port is it. It has taken four years and £13.5m to build the distillery, all of which has come from individual private investors. Meanwhile, Britain has left the EU (home to many of Scottish whisky’s biggest export destinations), and we’ve seen a pandemic, the worst cost-of-living crisis for a generation and an energy crisis that’s hitting the UK harder than anywhere in western Europe. And it takes huge amounts of energy to make whisky. Yet still the spirit flows. “As Britain’s economy stumbles,” ran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/business/economy/scotch-whisky-exports.html">a recent New York Times headline</a>, “one sector is booming: whisky.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/25/scotland-whisky-industry-bust-boom-exciting-new-distilleries">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When I took a job at a London comprehensive in a deprived area, I never realised how much I’d learn from the students about racism, creativity – and Shakespeare</p><p>The day I attended my interview for a job teaching at a challenging north London comprehensive school hadn’t begun in a particularly surprising way. I knew the score: prospective teachers are expected to take a lesson, then are given a tour of the school by student prefects and, finally, interviewed by the headteacher. It wasn’t until after I’d completed my morning teaching that things started to take an unconventional turn.</p><p>Three boys turned up to show me around the school and took me first to the stairwell where students urinated because the toilets were broken and dangerous.

One of the boys unlocked the door and we stood for a while, quietly looking out at a sweeping view of central London.

<p>Documentary follows Goldin, the artist who became addicted to OxyContin, as she confronts the wealthy art patrons who profited from its sale</p><p>The part of the Sackler family behind the company Purdue Pharma have become notorious for their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/24/purdue-pharma-oxycontin-pleads-guilty-opioid-crisis">addictive opioid painkiller OxyContin</a> which blighted innumerable American lives, while the Sacklers culturewashed the resulting colossal profits with conceited museum donations. There was hardly a museum in any first world capital city that didn’t salute their narcissism with a “Sackler wing” or a “Sackler courtyard”. Their story was first substantially told by the New Yorker’s investigative journalist Patrick Radden Keefe in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/18/empire-of-pain-review-sacklers-opioids-purdue-oxycontin-patrick-radden-keefe">his book Empire of Pain</a>.</p><p>Purdue’s creepy genius lay not in science, or pharmaceuticals, or medicine – but marketing. It wasn’t that they invented opioids; these had existed in various forms but had long been considered too dangerous for any but the most extreme pain management, or in terminal palliative care; Purdue simply persuaded the US medical profession to prescribe them in pill form for much less serious cases. Then the nation’s addiction agony was recycled into art-world prestige.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/25/all-the-beauty-and-the-bloodshed-review-nan-goldin-takes-on-big-pharma">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Champing’ has had a record year with people bedding down in churches across England and Wales while throwing a lifeline to these historic buildings</p><p>For millennia, pilgrims have taken time out from their epic hikes to overnight in churches, mosques, temples and monasteries to eat, sleep, pray and meditate while recovering from one day’s hard slog and preparing for the next. Christians keep up this practice on <a href="https://britishpilgrimage.org/routes/">pilgrimage routes</a> across Britain and Europe.</p><p>Now, people of all faiths and none are being invited to “champ” – church camp – in historic churches across England and Wales. The scheme was launched in 2016 by the Churches Conservation Trust (CCT), the charity that protects Anglican churches made “redundant” (closed) and considered at risk. The project offers unusual accommodation to travellers and provides churches with funds to keep buildings maintained.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jan/25/church-camping-champing-accommodation-walking-uk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Encanto meets Derry Girls in a fun fantasy series where everyone – apart from its lead character – has a superpower. Although some of the abilities are very mundane …</p><p>Extraordinary (Disney+) is Disney’s Encanto for grownups. Or Derry Girls with superpowers. There’s a bit of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/28/the-boys-the-explosive-superhero-show-thats-become-as-thrilling-as-game-of-thrones">The Boys</a>’ cynicism in there, too, and a dash of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/11/sex-education-review-netflix-asa-butterfield-gillian-anderson">Sex Education</a>’s youthful exuberance. Twenty-five-year-old Jen (Máiréad Tyers) is powerless – literally – in a world in which everyone acquires a superheroic skill when they turn 18. Sure, some are more impressive than others – you might get the gift of flight, invisibility or superspeed, but then again you might get the ability to turn “absolutely anything” into a PDF, or a bum that is also a 3D printer – but everyone has one ability. Except for our hero. Not only that but she is grieving, has a rubbish job (at a costume hire shop run by an ancient crone who hasn’t yet aged past 12) and a disastrous love life. And in this world, when a casual hookup wants to leave, they can just fly out of the window while you’re in the loo.</p><p>Jen does have one good, if drippy, friend – her flatmate Carrie (Sofia Oxenham). Though this does mean that her other flatmate is Carrie’s useless, sponging boyfriend Kash (Bilal Hasna) – a drain on both their resources, except for the odd occasion when his power to turn back time comes in handy. Carrie herself can channel the dead. In this version of reality, however, in which the background to every walk down the street is pleasingly filled by the sight of spontaneous fires, telekinesis at work and so on, her gift fits her for nothing better than a job at a local solicitors’ firm helping to settle inheritance claims via posthumous testimony in between making the bosses’ tea and coffee. “I’m basically an appliance.” It’s quarter-life crises all round.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/25/disney-extraordinary-review-help-my-bum-has-become-a-3d-printer">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> Thoroughbreds and Bad Education director Cory Finley makes an ambitious misstep with a jumbled comedy about controlling aliens</p><p>It’s become a depressingly familiar rite of passage for a director of vim and promise to stumble when they ambitiously decide to adapt a book that should have probably stayed on the shelf. Back in 2018, Blue Ruin and Green Room director Jeremy Saulnier came a cropper when he tried to wrangle William Giraldi’s unwieldy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/12/hold-the-dark-review-netflix-jeremy-saulnier-riley-keogh">Hold the Dark</a> to the screen. At Sundance in 2020, Dee Rees followed Pariah and Mudbound with a clunky, critically loathed attempt to turn Joan Didion’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/28/the-last-thing-he-wanted-review-misfiring-anne-hathaway-thriller">The Last Thing He Wanted</a> into a coherent film. And just last year Andrew Dominik and Noah Baumbach made their worst films to date with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/08/blonde-review-some-like-it-rotten-monroe-biopic-is-moving-explicit-and-intensely-irritating">Blonde</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/03/white-noise-review-noah-baumbach-don-delillo-adaptation-adam-driver-greta-gerwig">White Noise</a> respectively.</p><p>A strong attachment to the source material can of course be a good thing, a passion that can be clearly felt on screen, but it can also cloud one’s vision resulting in a messy, no-notes-taken blank cheque project that can often affect what cheques might follow. The latest victim is Cory Finley, who at the intimidatingly young age of 32, has already made two festival hits: dark teen comedy Thoroughbreds and knotty true crime drama Bad Education, featuring a never-better Hugh Jackman. But his third film is a bafflingly botched misfire, a frustratingly off-key adaptation of MT Anderson’s 2017 novel Landscape with Invisible Hand. What makes it that much more frustrating is that it’s not made without visible skill and there are some moving parts that are close to fully working but those that don’t quickly outnumber, a film that gets harder to defend with every scene.</p><p>Landscape with Invisible Hand premiered at the Sundance film festival and will be released later this year</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/24/landscape-with-invisible-hand-movie-review-sundance">Continue reading...</a>
