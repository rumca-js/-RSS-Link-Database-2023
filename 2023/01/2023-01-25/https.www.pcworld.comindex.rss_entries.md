<p>We&rsquo;ve been waiting for Microsoft&rsquo;s DirectStorage&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398899/microsoft-xbox-series-xs-directstorage-velocity-architecture-windows.html">the backbone of the Xbox Series X&rsquo;s ultra-fast storage technology</a>&mdash;to come to Windows for <em>years</em> now. After being <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/623036/microsoft-releases-directstorage-the-future-of-fast-loading-pc-games.html">released to developers last spring</a>, it&rsquo;s finally here, sinking its deep optimized-storage hooks into Square Enix&rsquo;s <em>Forspoken</em>, which released this week to middling reviews&hellip;and no review copies for PC reviewers. Ominous. So is the lightning-fast load-free future of PC gaming finally here?</p>



<p>Definitely maybe? <em>Forspoken </em>indeed sports some damned impressive loading times, but it&rsquo;s unclear how much of a difference DirectStorage itself makes in this game if you already have a fast NVMe SSD.</p>



<p>First, the good news. As spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.neowin.net/news/nvme-demand-could-shoot-up-as-microsoft-directstorage-in-forspoken-is-seen-working-its-magic/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Neowin</a>, several users report achieving blisteringly fast load times on the PC. (Since PC review copies weren&rsquo;t provided, user reports are key in these early days.) Twitter user <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/BlooHook/status/1617940784875175937&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">BlooHook</a> loaded all of <em>Forspoken</em>&rsquo;s benchmark scenes in under two seconds, as measured by the game. Impressive!</p>

<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/JJDizz1L/status/1617980959751823360&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">JJDizz1L</a>&mdash;who follows me on Twitter, hey JJDizz1L!&mdash;posted a similarly impressive video, showing <em>Forspoken </em>launching virtually instantaneously when he selected &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; after quitting the game. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blink or you&rsquo;ll miss it,&rdquo; he says, and he&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s <em>cool</em>!</p>



<p>But there are questions about whether those are the result of DirectStorage, or if <em>Forspoken</em> simply has ultra-fast loading times to begin with. On the r/hardware subreddit, user <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/10kipjx/comment/j5sprfa/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">skipan</a> noticed that the game only loads instantly when you&rsquo;re continuing from the most recent save. &ldquo;It seems they are &lsquo;cheating&rsquo; by preloading the most recent save file in the start screen,&rdquo; skipan said. &ldquo;I get instant load on the most recent one and a loading screen on older ones. Thats actually useful for the player experience but for benchmarking you should load an older save.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Skipan helpfully uploaded the following YouTube video showing the difference in load times after saving at the exact same spot twice, seen below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>As far as BlooHook&rsquo;s two-second load times go, our own Adam Patrick Murray was playing around with the <em>Forspoken </em>benchmark last night and reports he saw similar results on a system with a fast NVMe drive&mdash;but he&rsquo;s running Windows 10. Microsoft says DirectStorage will run on both Windows 10 and 11, with ostensible optimizations in the newer OS, but Square Enix says <em>Forspoken</em>&rsquo;s DirectStorage support only applies to Windows 11.</p>



<p>Finally, we have one reviewer report, and it paints a less rosy picture. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://wccftech.com/forspoken-pc-benchmark-test-checking-out-frame-rate-and-load-times-for-the-first-directstorage-game/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Wccftech</a> benchmarked <em>Forspoken</em>&rsquo;s loading times on an advanced gaming rig (Intel Core i7-12700KF, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, GeForce RTX 4090, WD Black SN850 NVMe SSD) and encountered good, but not stellar results. Several scenes loaded in under two seconds, but the longest took 7.5 and 9.5 seconds.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The average load time (not provided by the benchmark, so we calculated it manually) is 4.30 seconds, which is not what we hoped from DirectStorage compared to the one-second loads available on PS5,&rdquo; the site reports.</p>



<p>Square Enix&rsquo;s Sunil Godhania took to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/1680880/discussions/0/3766732716817835011/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the Steam forums</a> yesterday to say that &ldquo;By running a NVMe SSD drive, loading time may finish within 1~2 seconds. With SATA SSD it may take about 10 seconds,&rdquo; though he did note that the &ldquo;loading time may vary depending on other hardware configurations and the storage devices in use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s really going on here? Is DirectStorage supercharging NVMe load times on Windows 10 and 11 alike despite Square Enix&rsquo;s claim of Windows 11 exclusivity? Is the game just so well-optimized that it loads lightning-quick on Windows 10 even without official DirectStorage support? How much do your PC&rsquo;s specs matter? That Wccftech rig certainly is ferocious.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll need to investigate deeper and see DirectStorage implemented in more games to know for sure, especially as other PC users report that the game is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/forspokens-pc-port-is-another-fine-square-enix-mess/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a bit of a technical mess</a>. (There&rsquo;s a <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Forspoken</a></em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/&amp;xcust=2-1-1484183-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"> demo available</a> if you want to try it yourself.) A couple things seem clear, however. First, <em>Forspoken </em>has damned impressive load times no matter what, especially when resuming from your last save, and we want to see more of that regardless of the cause. And second, no matter what&rsquo;s going on with DirectStorage here, PC gamers <em>definitely</em> want to be gaming on an NVMe SSD rather than a SATA drive these days if at all possible.

<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This article was updated on 1/25/23 to reflect the addition of RTX 4080-class performance in GeForce Now&rsquo;s Ultimate plan (previously capped at RTX 3080). </em></p>



<p>GeForce Now is Nvidia&rsquo;s cloud-based game-streaming service. For those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with this concept, it means that Nvidia provides the hardware firepower via its own media servers. Instead of you installing a game to your PC and needing an expensive GPU to get the most out of it, you just need a strong, stable internet connection and a subscription to Nvidia&rsquo;s service, which can range from free to $20 per month. Note: The games themselves are not provided at any subscription level. More on that point when we talk about games below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p> Gameplay experience was virtually identical to loading up the game locally on my gaming rig. Every game I tested had similarly smooth and responsive experiences.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="the-plans">The plans</h2>



<p>GeForce Now currently offers three tiers: Free, Priority, and Ultimate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uniquely, GeForce Now is currently one of the only major cloud gaming services offering both a Free access plan and multiple free-to-play games. While many services offer a temporary free trial, the GeForce Now free plan is full access to the service with no long-term limitations. However, there are some short-term ones.</p>



<p>Each tier comes with a limit to how long you can be connected to a gaming session at a time. The Free tier is limited to one hour, Priority subscribers can play for up to six hours per session, and Ultimate subscribers get eight hour sessions. There is no set limit to the number of sessions you can start in a day.&nbsp;The free tier also doesn&rsquo;t feature &ldquo;RTX On,&rdquo; Nvidia&rsquo;s term for ray-tracing and DLSS support.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a priority component to the tiers, too, as Nvidia places limitations on the overall process and user loads on GeForce Now&rsquo;s regional data centers. Free members have the lowest priority in connecting to the service, which can mean waiting in line to connect to a rig at times. Priority and Ultimate have priority access to the queue, with Ultimate members getting access to systems that provide up to RTX 4080 GPUs (where available, as this support is rolling out in phases). There may be times when an RTX 4080 rig is not available for a member, which will revert to an RTX 3080 rig.</p>



<p>Beyond those varied limitations, GeForce Now advertises up to 1080p at 60 frames-per-second gameplay for its Priority members, and up to 4K at 120fps for PC/Mac and 4K HDR on Shield TV for its RTX 4080 members.</p>



<p>In the United States, where this review was done, the membership plans cost the following:</p>



<ul><li>Free </li><li>Priority: $9.99/month or $49.99/6 months</li><li>Ultimate: $19.99/month or $99.99/6 months</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce Now pricing" class="wp-image-1477082" height="727" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/geforcenowultimatepricing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>Additionally, there are internet bandwidth requirements and data usage conditions to consider. GeForce Now requires a minimum of a 15Mbps connection for 720p at 60fps, 25Mbps connection for 1080p at 60fps, and a 35Mbps connection for 1440p at 120fps for the RTX 4080 plan. Additionally, GeForce Now does require a less-than-80ms latency from an Nvidia data center, but recommends a less-than-40ms latency.</p>



<h2 id="game-library">Game library</h2>



<p>At first glance, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/games/&amp;xcust=2-1-630335-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">GeForce Now game library</a> is impressive&mdash;until you realize it&rsquo;s a list of games that are <em>playable</em> on the platform, not a list of games that are provided to you through the subscription as you find on other cloud gaming services.</p>



<p>You have to own your own digital copies of the games you wish to play on GeForce Now&mdash;and specifically have to own them on the correct platform for GeForce Now. This can be a bit messy if you&rsquo;re an existing PC gamer with a fairly large library on Steam or Epic Games Store, because you might own a game on one platform, but despite the game being available to play within GeForce Now, you might have it on the wrong platform to play within.</p>



<p>We ran into exactly this while testing with <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em>. Currently, only the Steam version of <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em> is available to play in GeForce Now, so if you own it on the Epic Games Store, you&rsquo;re out of luck. However, the original <em>Control</em> release is compatible with both Steam and Epic Game Store releases. None of that helped us though, as our copy of <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em> is on GOG, which largely isn&rsquo;t supported by GeForce Now with the exception of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and a few of the Witcher games.</p>



<p>In addition to your owned game library, you can play many Free to Play games such as <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em>, <em>Path of Exile</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, and more through GeForce Now. You do still need to set up your own account access on their relevant platforms.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re keen on the idea of owning your own game library or want to have some flexibility as to where you can game, without having to lug around a gaming rig, this service is worth checking out.</p>



<h2 id="user-experience">User experience</h2>



<p>Getting started with GeForce Now is fairly straightforward. You just have to register yourself with an account, or if you have an existing Nvidia/GeForce account, you can activate GeForce Now on it.</p>



<p>Once logged in and connected, you can choose to access the games through a Chrome, Safari, or Edge browser to try out some games without installing anything. However, in our experience, it&rsquo;s preferable to try out the native app instead, as the experience seems to work a bit more smoothly in both the menu navigation and in-game compared to the browser experience. Nvidia agrees, and tries to push you to install its app instead of using the browser.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce Now library" class="wp-image-631037" height="577" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GFN-Library.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The GeForce Now Library interface.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>You can choose to sync your Steam, Epic Games Store, and Ubisoft Connect accounts to your GeForce Now account, which will help filter the game library you see in GeForce Now to the titles you own and the platforms you have access to them on. However, syncing your account here seems to just help manage the library, as you&rsquo;ll need to log in to the relevant platform again when you go to play a game.</p>



<p>When you go to launch a game, it may put you in a queue depending on how busy things are for your access level. In our testing, the Free access had a typical queue time of a couple of minutes, the longest being eight minutes, but time of day and location will affect your experience. Once you&rsquo;re through the line, you&rsquo;ll launch into a full-screen view of what is effectively a very trimmed-down remote desktop environment. In there, you&rsquo;ll be prompted by the game&rsquo;s platform, such as Steam, asking you to log in to your account. Once logged in, your chosen game should launch right away.</p>



<p>All of the games within GeForce Now are installed and kept up to date on the service&rsquo;s end, so you won&rsquo;t need to wait for any patching or updates yourself. This seems to be standard to most cloud gaming services out there, but it&rsquo;s nice to not have to wait for the download and installation when starting up a new game.</p>



<p>As mentioned before, your play sessions do have a time limit, with the Free plan being only an hour. The one-hour session length can be frustrating when you have to log in, queue up, and end up in a longer <em>League of Legends</em> match, as the session might end before the game does. But it&rsquo;s enough time to work on some <em>Destiny</em> or <em>Warframe</em> dailies, or to get some piecemeal progress in <em>Far Cry 6</em> or <em>Life is Strange</em>. We did some testing to see if there were any short-term limitations on how many game sessions you could pop in and out of, though, and didn&rsquo;t seem to hit any kind of blocker. Additionally, GeForce Now&rsquo;s own FAQ confirms that there&rsquo;s no daily limits to the number of sessions you can play.</p>



<p>For some added flare, GeForce Now does support the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://developer.nvidia.com/highlights&amp;xcust=2-1-630335-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Nvidia Highlights</a> system, which is a feature with GeForce Experience and Nvidia GPUs that allows you to capture clutch moments, victory streaks, and other key experiences from your gameplay for supported games. When you launch a game that supports this feature in GeForce Now, it will let you know and how you can take advantage of it while playing.</p>



<h2 id="game-performance">Game performance</h2>



<p>Honestly, we were very impressed. With the right internet connection, playing some games in GeForce Now wasn&rsquo;t much different from playing them on a local PC. In our testing, the only notable difference was the 1080p experience being streamed to our higher-resolution display, but that was expected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For context, my testing connection has 400Mbps down, 25Mbps up, with a 24ms latency to Nvidia&rsquo;s Central U.S. server. Latency is one of the major concerns regarding cloud gaming services, understandably&mdash;particularly, if you&rsquo;re not physically located near one of the service&rsquo;s server locations. Since my testing conditions were within GeForce Now&rsquo;s recommended guidelines my experience was genuinely smooth when it came to the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of playing the game. I tried a handful of games, from action to puzzle, such as a high-speed fast clearing character in <em>Path of Exile</em>&mdash;an online-only action RPG with very chaotic moments and some very quick deaths, and the gameplay experience was virtually identical to loading up the game locally on my gaming rig. Every game I tested had similarly smooth and responsive experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also took advantage of a few games that have benchmarks within them, including <em>Far Cry 5</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Valhalla</em>. The results were all pretty much as advertised, with the Free and Priority tiers being virtually equivalent in performance. (Remember, however, your experience may vary depending on your internet connection and proximity to the servers.)  Interestingly, I was able to modify some of the display settings in some games, so I did get a look at a <em>Far Cry 5</em> High vs. Ultra benchmark, for example.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce Now Assassins Creed Valhalla Benchmark" class="wp-image-631050" height="678" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-Benchmark-results.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><br /><em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Valhalla</em> benchmark results on Priority plan.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce Now Assassins Creed Valhalla benchmark RTX 3080" class="wp-image-631053" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-Benchmark-RTX-3080-results.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Valhalla</em> benchmark results on RTX 3080 plan.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>Some games were able to give me insight into the actual hardware running the GeForce Now systems. According to my tests, via <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Valhalla</em>, the Free and Priority service seem to be running with Intel CC150 CPUs at 3.5GHz and the graphics are listed as Nvidia Tesla T10, which by my estimation would be the T10-8s, as those are the RTX series T10 cards for this kind server environment. The RTX 3080 systems seem to be running AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3955WX CPUs and Nvidia A10G GPU, resulting in an overall more impressive experience, both in resolution and performance.</p>



<p>See Matthew Smith&rsquo;s hands-on evaluation of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477077/tested-nvidia-geforce-now-unlocks-rtx-4080-grunt-and-its-a-win-for-your-wallet.html">GeForce Now&rsquo;s Ultimate tier with RTX 4080-class performance</a>, which started rolling out to select markets (with more to come) after our original review was written.  </p>



<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom line</h2>



<p>Long story short, playing a game at any plan tier is a genuinely solid experience as long as your internet connection can handle it. While having to bring your own games may be a bit of a bummer compared to other cloud gaming options out there, the overall performance and quality of GeForce Now is impressive. At the very least, they have a Free plan, so give it a whirl if you can&mdash;especially if you&rsquo;ve had trouble dredging up a new graphics card over the last year.</p>

<p>Bluehost is a WordPress-endorsed web hosting platform that offers a wide array of hosting services. The initial startup price can&rsquo;t be beat, and Bluehost offers generous features and easy on-boarding for first-time website owners. However, support and reliability are subpar, with competitors like HostGator and InMotion Hosting having an edge.</p>



<h2 id="bluehost-pricing">Bluehost: Pricing</h2>



<p>One of Bluehost&rsquo;s top advantages is its competitive <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bluehost.com/pricing&amp;xcust=2-1-1468898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">introductory pricing</a> for its services. The amount you&rsquo;ll save on your first purchase depends on which type of plan you go with and how many months you decide to purchase the plan for during your initial checkout.</p>



<p>The amount you can expect to save, though, ranges anywhere from 20 percent to as much as 76 percent. For example, if you subscribe to Bluehost&rsquo;s Shared Hosting service for 12 months, this is what the initial fee versus the renewal fee looks like.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="bluehost pricing" class="wp-image-1468939" height="333" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bluehost-pricing-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="943" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Or, if you wanted to go with the Dedicated Hosting service for maximum performance and optimization, this is what you&rsquo;d expect to pay initially versus if you renew.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Bluehost pricing" class="wp-image-1471782" height="292" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bluehost-pricing-3-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="943" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Bluehost&rsquo;s introductory rates are hard to beat, but be prepared for a steep increase (50 percent or more) once it&rsquo;s time for renewal. However, even when the rate increases to its standard rate, the plans are on par with most competitors, with HostGator having a slight edge.</p>



<p>The plan you go with should depend solely on what you expect out of a website. If you just want to build a site to showcase your portfolio, then hosting on a shared server will suffice. Even if you plan on growing your site, starting off on a shared server is likely your best choice. Once you start getting serious traffic, it may be time to consider switching over to a dedicated server to increase overall performance.</p>



<p>Bluehost offers a full refund if you cancel your subscription within 30 days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>One of Bluehost&rsquo;s strong suits is its beginner-centric setup process. It also provides many generous features across all its plans.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="bluehost-setup">Bluehost: Setup</h2>



<p>Another of Bluehost&rsquo;s strong suits is its beginner-centric setup process. Bluehost offers a variety of customer support services, from website migration to completely building your site for you. The company also has a dedicated team of WordPress Experts ready to assist you.</p>



<p>If you want to set up everything yourself, Bluehost has plenty of documentation, but finding that documentation on its site is a different story. While Bluehost offers an intuitive control panel that&rsquo;s easy to navigate for users, they make it quite difficult to locate documentation in the knowledge base. There <em>is</em> a 24/7 support team available via chat online, but if you&rsquo;re not interested in waiting in lines or just like to figure things out for yourself, you&rsquo;ll soon realize the site structure leaves much to be desired.</p>



<h2 id="bluehost-features">Bluehost: Features</h2>



<p>Bluehost provides many generous features across all of its plans. Each plan includes unmetered bandwidth and unlimited domains, aside from the Basic plan where you get one domain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Basic plan also includes 10GB SSD storage, what Bluehost is calling &ldquo;Website Storage,&rdquo; which is a large decrease compared to its previous 50GB offering. The Plus, Choice Plus, and Pro plans used to offer unlimited storage, but now have been downgraded to 20GB, 40GB, and 100GB, respectively. In addition to the storage capacities, there&rsquo;s also a limit to the number of files you can host, though the maximum is up to a couple hundred thousand, meaning you&rsquo;ll most likely never hit the cap unless you&rsquo;re a file-sharing website.</p>



<p>The Plus, Choice Plus, and Pro plans also offer unlimited databases, whereas the Basic plan allows for 20. However, the max database size for each plan is 5GB.</p>



<p>There are also many other offerings, such as email accounts and storage, dedicated IPs, allowed subdomains, and more. Here&rsquo;s an at-a-glance overview of each plans&rsquo; offerings.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Bluehost features" class="wp-image-1469049" height="500" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bluehost-features.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="629" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>



<h2 id="bluehost-backup-and-security">Bluehost: Backup and security</h2>



<p>Bluehost offers decent backup and security features, though what&rsquo;s available to you depends on which plan you sign up for. Bluehost offers free malware scanning via SiteLock across all of its plans, as well as a free Let&rsquo;s Encrypt SSL certificate&mdash;though you&rsquo;ll have to pay for it after the first year if you&rsquo;re subscribed to the Basic plan.</p>



<p>Bluehost also offers its Choice Plus and Pro subscribers free daily site backups with CodeGuard, with Choice Plus members having to pay a renewal fee after the first year. You can pay for it separately if it doesn&rsquo;t come with your plan. It&rsquo;s highly recommended you do daily backups of your site (or of any of your data, for that matter), so it&rsquo;s well worth the $4 monthly price tag.</p>



<h2 id="bluehost-reliability">Bluehost: Reliability</h2>



<p>Server uptime is extremely important for websites, as any downtime directly impacts revenue. Though you will see claims online that Bluehost has a 99.98 percent server uptime, Bluehost itself only <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bluehost.com/resources/features-a-good-web-host-should-provide/#Uptime:~:text=Bluehost%20has%20a%20guaranteed%2099.9%25%20uptime.&amp;xcust=2-1-1468898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">promises 99.9 percent</a>.</p>



<p>Also interesting, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bluehost.com/resources/features-a-good-web-host-should-provide/#Uptime:~:text=The%20best%20web,Backup%20servers%3A&amp;xcust=2-1-1468898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bluehost mentions in a blog post</a> that a good web host should provide backup servers, but then <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/help/499#:~:text=to%208%20hours.-,Why%20don%27t%20you%20have%20server%20redundancy%3F,-We%20have%20invested&amp;xcust=2-1-1468898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">mentions on its FAQ page</a> that it doesn&rsquo;t offer server redundancy on shared hosting plans because it would increase the cost.</p>



<p>So what&rsquo;s the real story? Bluehost does, in general, have good uptime, and provides a way for you to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bluehost.com/help/article/getting-alerts-on-your-sites-downtime-and-tracking-uptime-history&amp;xcust=2-1-1468898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">track it yourself</a> (though you have to set it up yourself). Server issues were few and far between when we hosted <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://vgkami.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1468898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a gaming guides website</a> on Bluehost&mdash;though we did experience one issue where the site was down for many hours, sporadically throughout the course of several days, with no announcements from Bluehost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The month prior to the server issues, we had 679,916 Pageviews. The month of the server issues, 592,560. Though there are many variables involved, the sporadic server downtime certainly didn&rsquo;t help, and we were left scrambling to figure out what was wrong due to no announcement being delivered by Bluehost. This, along with the poor communication from support during this time, ultimately led to us migrating to a different web hosting platform the following month.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bluehost performance" class="wp-image-1469054" height="698" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bluehost-performance_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>



<p>On the other hand, when there&rsquo;s a regularly scheduled maintenance coming up, Bluehost alerts you via email well in advance so you can prepare for it, and these updates are scheduled during times when it will impact the fewest amount of customers. This is good news for U.S.-based customers, as updates generally won&rsquo;t be held during peak hours.</p>



<h2 id="bluehost-customer-support">Bluehost: Customer support</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re not a fan of human interaction, you can browse <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bluehost.com/help&amp;xcust=2-1-1468898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bluehost&rsquo;s online knowledge base</a> to see if there is some documentation that helps answer your questions. While the knowledge base is plentiful, as mentioned above, it can be quite difficult to locate the content you need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you would rather talk to a real person, Bluehost boasts a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week support system, available via phone or live chat. This is on par with other hosting service providers, such as InMotion Hosting and HostGator.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the quality of Bluehost&rsquo;s support has been hit or miss for me. If the question is simple, you&rsquo;ll likely have a good experience. During the service interruption mentioned earlier, though, it appeared Support was out of the loop and wasn&rsquo;t able to answer questions, or got periodically disconnected during a support session. Plus there was the days-long delay until an official announcement was made. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Bluehost support" class="wp-image-1469056" height="491" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bluehost-Support.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="352" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>



<p>With no word from Bluehost and no help from support during this time, we were left with a less-than-desirable experience.</p>



<h2 id="bluehost-final-thoughts">Bluehost: Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Bluehost is a great hosting provider for first-time website owners. It offers easy onboarding and setup, which allows you to get your site up and running quickly with no technical knowledge required.</p>



<p>The initial cost is also the best in the business, making it a desirable choice for users on a budget. However, the renewal fee puts it at par with other services, and even slightly higher, as compared to HostGator. If the subscription cost is a concern, you&rsquo;ll want to think long-term when deciding who to go with.</p>



<p>Finally, if uptime and customer support is critical to your business, there are more reliable hosting providers that would be better suited for you. If you&rsquo;re creating a site as a passion project or online portfolio and downtime isn&rsquo;t a big concern, then you should still strongly consider Bluehost.</p>

## LastPass owner GoTo says hackers stole encrypted backups and keys

<p>It&rsquo;s been almost two months since <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419901/lastpass-got-hacked-again-and-this-time-your-data-got-taken.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">LastPass owner GoTo confirmed that its company had been hacked</a> in November of last year, exposing user data for a number of its security- and access-focused products. But hackers also breached GoTo&rsquo;s other products: Central, Pro, join.me, Hamachi, and RemotelyAnywhere. In an update concerning those breaches yesterday, GoTo gave more info that&rsquo;s cause for concern: in addition to taking encrypted data from a shared third-party server, the hackers managed to get the encryption key, too. </p>



<p>The LastPass hack was already fairly devastating for a company that&rsquo;s all about securing users&rsquo; data. Previously we knew that usernames and passwords, as well as billing info, email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses were stolen. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.goto.com/blog/our-response-to-a-recent-security-incident&amp;xcust=2-1-1483993-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The update says</a> that in addition to all of that, more usernames and passwords (including salted and hashed passwords), multi-factor authentication settings, and licensing info was taken from users of Central, Pro, join.me, Hamachi, and RemotelyAnywhere. GoToMyPC and Rescue support databases were, apparently, not stolen, nor were credit card numbers. </p>



<p>The update doesn&rsquo;t say how many users were affected &mdash; in fact, GoTo hasn&rsquo;t given that information at all so far. But the post says that &ldquo;we are contacting affected customers directly&rdquo; and recommending steps to protect their account info. Affected users&rsquo; passwords on the related GoTo products have been reset by the company. User accounts are being migrated to an &ldquo;enhanced Identity Management Platform&rdquo; with more robust security. </p>



<p>The update is the latest in a string of embarrassing news for GoTo and LastPass. The November hack follows a similar event <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917244/lastpass-got-hacked-but-you-werent-2.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">in August of last year</a>, apparently related, and in the combined breaches both internal company information and customer data was compromised.

<p>You&rsquo;ve got to check out this Asus ZenBook Pro 15 OLED laptop deal because it&rsquo;s sleek, zippy, and $400 off. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/pine-gray-asus-zenbook-pro-um535qe-nh71t-content-creation-home-personal/p/N82E16834236180&amp;xcust=2-1-1483926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Newegg&rsquo;s currently selling this machine for just $999.99</a>, which is 27 percent off of the original price. It&rsquo;s a great laptop for productivity tasks, everyday use, and even some light gaming (I know!). Let&rsquo;s jump right into it then.</p>



<p>The ZenBook Pro 15 is rocking an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. This laptop is designed for creative folks, so it&rsquo;s not that unusual to see one with a discrete graphics card to go along with the other potent internals. Still, it&rsquo;s a welcome boost of power. The 15.6-inch OLED display is rather roomy with a resolution of 1920&times;1080. According to Asus, the display has a maximum brightness of 400 nits. OLED displays look absolutely gorgeous, with delicious contrast ratios, so a bright one like this should look even better.</p>



<p>This is a killer deal. You better act now before it&rsquo;s gone forever.</p>

## Best free VPN of 2023: Itâ€™s important to choose wisely

<p>Virtual private networks (VPNs) are one of the most effective ways to stay safe while online. They allow you to stay anonymous and get past region blocks on certain websites. However, VPNs usually cost money and you don&rsquo;t always want to add an extra monthly expense to an already tight budget. That&rsquo;s where free VPNs come in. They can provide you with a similar level of security for virtually&mdash;pun intended&mdash;nothing. But not all free VPNs are built the same. Oftentimes, when things sound too good to be true, they usually are.</p>



<p>With many free VPNs you&rsquo;ll encounter unexpected restrictions such as speeds, a bandwidth cap, or a limit to the countries you can access. Essentially, you get what you pay for. While we advise that you opt for a premium VPN, such as those in our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the best VPNs</a>, we understand that sometimes you just need quick and easy basic protection without having to pay for yet another service. Therefore we&rsquo;ve curated a list of the best free VPNs you can find. Following our recommendations you can read about what to look for in a free VPN and how we test.</p>

<p>The Windscribe VPN service seems to get better and better each time we review a new version. It not only has an excellent Pro version that is reasonably priced, but it has a stand-out free service as well. What makes Windscribe&rsquo;s free service really stand out is all the perks. You get a maximum 10GB of bandwidth per month and no device limits. To get that bandwidth you need a confirmed email address. If not, you&rsquo;re stuck at 2GB per month.</p>

<p>The free service offers 10 regional connections including the U.S., Canada, UK, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, and Romania. It also has a ton of privacy features such as blockers for site notifications and &ldquo;we use cookies&rdquo; banners, WebRTC leak protection, location spoofing, user agent rotation, and more.</p>

<p>The service is also extremely easy to use with a simple setup and solid performance for a free VPN. We not only recommend the Windscribe free service on its own, but also as an easy way to get to know the service before committing to a paid tier with premium features.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for speed and excellent privacy in a free VPN then ProtonVPN is an excellent choice. There are some big limitations with this service, but thankfully no limitations on speeds. </p>

<p>Instead, ProtonVPN limits you to one device connection at a time, and you only get three countries to choose from including the U.S., the Netherlands, and Japan. Still, that&rsquo;s a good deal, making this a very useful free VPN. </p>

<p>ProtonVPN is the second-fastest VPN in our tests making this the one you want if speed is important to you.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s close to two years since we last reviewed this VPN, but even so, its speeds are within the top 20. That makes it plenty speedy for the typical use cases for a free VPN.

<p>We&rsquo;ve always really liked TunnelBear. It&rsquo;s simple to use, affordable, and the speeds are fine. In our speed tests, TunnelBear was outside the top 20, but its speeds were still good last we looked, with an average global speed of 30.6 megabytes per second.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s more than enough for what this free VPN would be suited for, since you get a maximum of 500MB per month. The idea is to provide a trial for testing out the service before making a bigger commitment. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s enough for quick hits when you&rsquo;re on the road for checking email, or some basic web browsing. Plus, TunnelBear keeps track of your bandwidth usage so you can see when you&rsquo;re getting too close to the limit. </p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-free-vpn">What to look for in a free VPN</h2>



<p>Choosing a free VPN is a question of weighing the trade-offs with each service. Do you want unlimited bandwidth, but a restriction on devices? Or is it preferable to have more devices but deal with a bandwidth limit? </p>



<p>One thing you definitely want to avoid is a VPN that is ad supported. Ads expose you to tracking by the company delivering ads, which is probably something you don&rsquo;t want. You also want to stay away from any deal that suggests you can get a VPN by &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; your bandwidth like we saw with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/427726/ultra-popular-hola-vpn-extension-sold-your-bandwidth-for-use-in-a-botnet-attack.html">the Hola VPN scandal</a> back in 2015. You also want to watch out for any VPNs you&rsquo;ve never heard of, or that haven&rsquo;t been reviewed much by third parties. </p>



<p>After that, you want to consider the usual issues such as the privacy policy, Netflix support, operating system support, and the countries that you&rsquo;re looking for. </p>



<h2 id="how-we-test-vpns">How we test VPNs</h2>



<p>All VPNs are tested on a Windows machine with an Ethernet connection. Our approach is not to show you actual speeds, since those can vary based on any number of factors like your ISP, time of day, device quality, and so on. Instead, we show the average bandwidth loss as a percentage since there&rsquo;s always going to be bandwidth loss with VPNs. </p>



<p>Each VPN is tested over three days. On each testing day, we first take the base speed with no VPN active. Then we test the speeds in five different countries three times each. Once all the testing is done we create a global average and compare that to the average base speed, and then express the drop in bandwidth as a percentage for the reasons we mentioned above. </p>



<p>Free VPNs aren&rsquo;t a top recommendation, but if you&rsquo;re going to go that way we&rsquo;d strongly suggest the five VPNs mentioned here. </p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A VPN, or Virtual private network, is a way to encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your identity while browsing the internet. Through a VPN provider, you connect to their anonymized server with end-to-end encryption which redirects all of your traffic through that intermediary server thereby looking to outside viewers as if your location is that server itself.</p>



<p>Additionally, VPNs allow you to connect to servers all across the world. So if you are looking to access location restricted content, such as streaming services, you can gain access via connecting to the appropriate country&rsquo;s server.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-a-vpn-work">How does a VPN work?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A VPN hides your IP address by redirecting it through a intermediary server hosted by the VPN provider. To anyone watching, the VPN server then becomes the source of your traffic instead of your own IP address. These remote servers can not only be in your own country, but they can also be located in different countries around the world. All of your network traffic from your computer to the VPN is sent over a secure and encrypted connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While browsing the internet and connected to a VPN, the VPN acts as a middleman between your computer and a website. Your computer sends a request to the VPN which then passes it on to a website. The website in return sends its response back to the VPN which forwards it through the secure connection back to your computer. All of the traffic rerouted through the VPN appears as if it is coming through their server rather than your own computer. This keeps your ISP and other third parties from potentially snooping on your internet activity.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Absolutely! In most countries, including the United States, it is perfectly legal to use a VPN. You might notice that some websites try to block VPN connections, but they are still okay to use. Please note, while using a VPN is legal, some of the activities done <em>while using</em> a VPN might be illegal. Activities such as downloading pirated copyrighted content or accessing dark web markets are both illegal with and without a VPN.</p>

## 4 reasons to switch to Windows 11 (and 5 reasons not to)

<p>It&rsquo;s finally time to upgrade to Windows 11. Or is it?</p>



<p>A little more than a year ago, our initial <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/539183/windows-11-review-an-unnecessary-replacement-for-windows-10.html">review of Windows 11</a> called Microsoft&rsquo;s latest operating system &ldquo;unnecessary.&rdquo; Windows 10 was such a strong entrant within the Windows succession that we saw no need to move on to something new. It&rsquo;s time now, however, that we think you should start seriously considering it.</p>



<p>Why? Because the landscape has changed. Microsoft now provides some very good reasons to move to Windows 11, some of which weren&rsquo;t available at launch. Some PCWorld staffers have switched full time to Windows 11, and the goal of this story originally set out to convince you that it was time to switch to Windows 11.</p>



<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem. Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t seem as determined to convince you to upgrade to Windows 11 as it once did. Our arguments that you should switch had too many caveats attached. So we decided to contrast the two strategies: why you should switch to Windows 11, and why you should remain on Windows 10. After all, it&rsquo;s all about what&rsquo;s best for you.</p>



<h2 id="why-you-should-switch-to-windows-11">Why you should switch to Windows 11</h2>



<h3 id="try-before-you-buy">Try before you buy</h3>



<p>Quite simply, Microsoft isn&rsquo;t selling Windows 10 any more. All new PCs now ship with Windows 11, and any options to buy a Windows 10 PC instead have largely gone away. </p>



<p>Upgrading your existing PC gives you a flexibility a new PC doesn&rsquo;t offer. After upgrading from Windows 10 to 11, you have ten days to revert. After that, if you&rsquo;ve upgraded from a Windows 10 device, you can reinstall Windows 10 via a clean installation.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5" class="wp-image-1440830" height="979" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/straight-on-unedited.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Buy a new laptop, and you&rsquo;re going to get Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>If you buy a Windows 11 laptop, you may have the option to downgrade to Windows 10, but not always. You&rsquo;ll likely need to contact that laptop manufacturer and inquire if those rights are available, which basically means that the laptop manufacturer has committed to supplying hardware drivers for Windows 10. Without them, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the clean installation will work.</p>



<p>In other words, you have an opportunity to try out Windows 11 now, rather than being forced into it. Why not try it out, then revert back to Windows 10 if it&rsquo;s still not for you?</p>



<h3 id="windows-11-will-get-features-windows-10-wont">Windows 11 will get features Windows 10 won&rsquo;t</h3>



<p>Some users prefer Microsoft leave Windows alone, making users the only agent of change on their PCs. But for those who <em>like</em> new features&hellip; well, don&rsquo;t expect many to arrive on Windows 10 anytime soon. The last two feature releases have basically passed over Windows 10, reserving the new features only for Windows 11, and not the older Windows 10.</p>



<p>Granted, Microsoft isn&rsquo;t exactly issuing major revisions of Windows 11 with every new feature update, either. Windows 11&rsquo;s 2022 Update marked a return to the annual update cadence, with Microsoft seemingly spending more time updating its apps and services as opposed to the operating system itself.  But it&rsquo;s clear that Microsoft&rsquo;s time and attention is being spent on Windows 11, and not Windows 10.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 22H2 Snap Bar" class="wp-image-830031" height="587" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Snap-Bar-dark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Windows Snap may be a new twist on an old feature, but it&rsquo;s still an excellent addition to Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/827065/windows-11-22h2-review-subtle-improvements-but-not-where-it-should.html">review of Windows 11&rsquo;s 2022 Update</a> (aka Windows 11 22H2) indicated some key improvements: Snap Bar/Snap Groups, live captioning of recorded video, Voice Access, and more. Windows 11 itself initially shipped with significant upgrades to the Settings app. Say what you want about these features (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/830006/my-favorite-feature-in-windows-11-22h2-is.html">the updated Snap is our favorite</a>) but none of these have arrived on Windows 10. </p>



<h3 id="windows-11-has-exclusive-new-apps">Windows 11 has exclusive new apps</h3>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s many development teams continue to work on parallel tracks: on the operating system itself, on Office, services, and more. While not all of Microsoft&rsquo;s new applications seem to be reserved for Windows 11 (like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477261/windows-11s-old-photos-app-is-still-better.html">updated, <em>worse</em> Photos app</a>, for example) a couple are: the spiffy new Windows Media Player, for example. If you try downloading it on Windows 10, the OS will try to load the legacy Groove Music app instead.</p>



<p>A better example would be Windows&rsquo; new Android apps, once just a few hundred and now increased to thousands, according to Microsoft and Amazon. Granted, the Amazon Android appstore works best on tablets, and for those who like mobile games. But it&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;re not going to find on Windows 10. Android 13 should be arriving soon, as it&rsquo;s available as an upgrade for Windows Insiders.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-solve-windows-11s-problems-through-utilities">You can solve Windows 11&rsquo;s problems through utilities</h3>



<p>We&rsquo;re not going to sit here and defend <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549576/the-windows-11-taskbar-is-an-annoying-step-backward.html">Windows 11&rsquo;s flaws</a>. We continue to dislike Windows 11&rsquo;s implementation of the Start Menu, for example, and while the centered taskbar allows for plenty of space for icons on a 4K or widescreen display, not everyone has one.</p>



<p>Windows 11 does allow for ways around these limitations, though. I personally launch apps by typing the Windows key, then the first letters of the app itself, or simply <strong>Alt-Tab</strong> through available windows. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394988/fix-windows-11s-start-menu-with-stardocks-simple-new-app.html">Stardock&rsquo;s Start11</a>, however allows you to redo the Windows 11 Start menu to make it look like Windows 10 or earlier operating systems, and align the taskbar in various portions of the screen. It&rsquo;s a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.stardock.com/products/start11/download?irgwc=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1471886-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$5.99 utility</a> that makes Windows 11 feel familiar and more productive.</p>

<h2 id="why-you-should-stay-on-windows-10">Why you should stay on Windows 10</h2>



<p>While we think that those are valid reasons to upgrade to Windows 11, we just can&rsquo;t help but think that Microsoft isn&rsquo;t entirely committed to pushing you towards Windows 11. Or if it is, its own business models contradict those efforts. </p>



<p>Some of these arguments, however, boil down to simple ease of use &mdash; such as the first.</p>



<h3 id="why-stay-on-windows-10-familiarity">Why stay on Windows 10? Familiarity</h3>



<p>There&rsquo;s something to be said to stumbling into your office after a long night, booting your PC, and feeling your way through the beginning of the day. With those first few mornings on Windows 11, you may have to consciously think about what to do. An operating system that you&rsquo;re familiar with is one that you&rsquo;re more productive in. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 10 desktop" class="wp-image-1407331" src="https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/features/3806955/comprar-windows-10.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /><figcaption>If you know Windows 10, why not stick with it?</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>While we&rsquo;re not claiming that Windows 11 is radically different than Windows 10, upgrading comes with its own potential hassles, unexpected tweaks to Settings and other preferences, and so on. The new interface is very similar, but also very different. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just easier to stick with the tried and true.</p>



<h3 id="windows-10-will-get-new-apps-via-subscriptions-anyway">Windows 10 will get new apps via subscriptions anyway</h3>



<p>Yes, Windows 11 does offer some exclusive new apps, but not <em>that</em> many. And there&rsquo;s another catch, too.</p>



<p>Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has referred to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/694088/nadella-windows-is-the-socket-for-subscriptions.html">Windows as a &ldquo;socket&rdquo; for Windows services</a>, and while it&rsquo;s fair to say that the company is prioritizing Windows 11, Microsoft loves subscription revenue even more. Microsoft&rsquo;s More Personal Computing Business (Windows and Xbox) has steadily lost money over the past year, as sales of PCs and Xbox consoles has slowed. But sales of Microsoft&rsquo;s Productivity and Business business have increased, primarily because the business unit makes money on Office subscriptions for consumers and corporations. It makes sense, then, that Microsoft would continue doubling down on what makes it money, subscriptions, and make those subscriptions available to as many people as possible.</p>

<p>Some of these applications, like Clipchamp and Designer, are Web &ldquo;apps&rdquo; specifically designed to run on both Windows 10 and Windows 11. Both, however, come with subscriptions: optional &ldquo;professional&rdquo; content for Clipchamp, and Designer will be part of Microsoft 365. Add to that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Microsoft 365 &mdash; heck, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/422732/microsoft-wants-you-to-pay-for-solitaire-again-in-windows-10.html">even Solitaire had a subscription to eliminate ads</a> before it was added to Game Pass. All of these subscriptions will work on both Windows 10 and Windows 11.</p>



<h3 id="will-your-pc-even-run-windows-11">Will your PC even run Windows 11?</h3>



<p>Quite frankly, the transition to Windows 11 has always been surrounded by a &ldquo;will they or won&rsquo;t they approach&rdquo; to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394763/windows-11-system-hardware-requirements.html">Windows 11&rsquo;s hardware requirements</a>. For a while, the restrictions that Microsoft put on the available supported processors made Windows 11 desirable; no one likes being told that they <em>can&rsquo;t</em> upgrade, especially when they&rsquo;ve paid good money for an existing PC. Then there were the exceptions, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/542121/microsoft-reveals-how-to-bypass-windows-11s-strict-hardware-requirements.html">the workarounds</a>. In the end, the hassle in upgrading an older PC to Windows 11 might make some people ride it out until they get a new PC.</p>



<p>No one, least of all Microsoft, wants PC users to be hacked. But it&rsquo;s to Microsoft&rsquo;s credit that no major exploit really plagued Windows 10 <em>or</em> Windows 11.</p>



<h3 id="is-windows-11-faster-than-windows-10-no">Is Windows 11 faster than Windows 10? No</h3>



<p>On paper, there&rsquo;s another compelling reason to move to Windows 11: performance. If you&rsquo;re running a laptop with an Intel Core CPU inside of it (and more than 80 percent of laptops sold during 2022 included an Intel chip inside) Microsoft and Intel teamed up to offer Thread Director, a software API that controls how the various performance and efficiency cores of Intel&rsquo;s Core architecture interact with the operating system. Intel&rsquo;s Thread Director is supposed to work on both Windows 10 and Windows 11, but with improvements that would make Windows 11 faster.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, our recent tests don&rsquo;t bear that out. Simply put, there just <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448055/do-you-really-need-to-update-to-windows-11.html">isn&rsquo;t any measurable performance difference between Windows 10 and Windows 11</a> right now. In fairness, Windows 11 is a little faster, but just not that much to be significant.</p>



<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, you can&rsquo;t help but be a bit suspicious of DirectStorage, the next-generation storage accelerator that Microsoft is promising. In 2021, Microsoft promised that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394868/microsoft-directstorage-windows-10-after-all.html">DirectStorage would be made available to both Windows 10 <em>and</em> Windows 11 users</a>, good news for those who don&rsquo;t want to upgrade. In 2022, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/623036/microsoft-releases-directstorage-the-future-of-fast-loading-pc-games.html">Microsoft began shipping DirectStorage</a>, a technology that promises to speed up games by improving how the SSD interacts with the GPU to improve data transfers. </p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/626171/626171.html">watch DirectStorage slash game loading times down to a second</a> on the first game to support it, <em>Forspoken</em>, which releases on Jan. 24.  But the demo video showed how DirectStorage compared to an existing hard drive and M.2 / SATA SSD&hellip;not Windows 10. Our guess is that if you own the right hardware, which operating system you run won&rsquo;t make that much of a difference.</p>



<h3 id="you-can-procrastinate-in-switching-to-windows-11">You can procrastinate in switching to Windows 11</h3>



<p>All that, though, is pretty in the weeds for most people. For many, the question will simply boil down to: do I really <em>need</em> to upgrade? The answer, simply put, is no &mdash; not yet. Windows 10 ends support on Oct. 14, 2025, meaning that if you really can&rsquo;t deal with the added pressure of upgrading &mdash; as relatively simple as it is &mdash; then don&rsquo;t! Windows 11 will still be there in a year or two.</p>

<p>The Pro X Superlight looks about as straightforward as a pro-grade wireless gaming mouse can get, with an extremely minimalist right-handed design. In fact, it sports just five buttons: two main clicks, two left-side buttons, and a mouse wheel. Yet, its Hero sensor is anything but simple, treating gamers to a maximum resolution of 25,600 DPI and impressively fast tracking.</p>



<p>Although you won&rsquo;t find any RGB lighting here, the Pro X Superlight just oozes sophistication, which makes you feel like you&rsquo;ve got something really special. Like a fine leather wallet or designer bow tie, this mouse feels exceptionally well-made, offering pro or casual gamers a premium experience worth savoring.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: Go to our ongoing roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/559298/best-wireless-gaming-mice.html">best wireless gaming mice</a> to learn more about competing products, what to look for in a wireless gaming mouse, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h3 id="logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-design-and-build">Logitech G Pro X Superlight: Design and build</h3>



<p>The most striking thing about the Pro X Superlight, as its name suggests, is its extremely light weight. It weighs less than 63 grams (2.3 oz), which Logitech G has achieved without including any weight-lowering perforations. That puts it on par with some of the lightest pro-grade wireless mice you can get&mdash;mice like the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro. Suffice to say, it&rsquo;s a marvel to wield, feeling barely perceptible in your hand and providing frictionless play all day long.</p>



<p>But despite its weight, the Pro X Superlight is by no means flimsy, and feels both remarkably sturdy and surprisingly tactile. My review unit&rsquo;s black, plastic top and sides provided me plenty of grip right out of the box. But adding the supplied extra grips did give me just that little bit more. These extra coverings also helped prevent the fingerprints that accumulated in my first few games. </p>



<p>The fingerprints that showed up were nothing drastic, but if they do bother you, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to hear the Pro X Superlight also comes in pink, red, and white color options that look equally as stunning and will show fewer prints.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Like a fine leather wallet or designer bow tie, this mouse feels exceptionally well-made, offering pro or casual gamers a premium experience worth savoring.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1475713" height="690" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Logitech-G-Pro-X-Superlight_RRP299.90_white-12.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1037" /><figcaption><p>.The  Logitech  G Pro X Superlight comes in four stylish color options.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Logitech G</p></div>



<p>In a market where pro gaming mice are predominantly large it&rsquo;s refreshing to see one as compact as the Pro X Superlight which measures just 4.9 x 2.5 x 1.6 inches. Such a compact size is ideal for gamers that use fingertip or claw grips who will find it easier than some mice to reach the trigger zone.</p>



<p>For connectivity, a 2.4GHz low-latency dongle provides a flawless Wi-Fi experience. There&rsquo;s no Bluetooth connectivity to speak of, but this won&rsquo;t be any big issue for serious gamers who will undoubtedly be happy with the faster and more stable Logitech G Lightspeed Wi-Fi connectivity, anyway.</p>



<h3 id="logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-software">Logitech G Pro X Superlight: Software</h3>



<p>The Pro X Superlight makes use of Logitech&rsquo;s G Hub software app, which is your one-stop shop for DPI calibrations, key assignments, and to set up or tweak the five onboard memory profiles. It&rsquo;s a straightforward program that&rsquo;s well laid out with visual cues and lists for easy navigation.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1475711" height="776" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Logitech-G-Hub.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The <p>Logitech G Hub software app splits assignments between five submenus which really simplifies the process.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>One of the best things about G Hub is that it splits up your assignments among five submenus. This makes it a whole lot easier to manage your most useful commands and actions. I have to lift my cap to Logitech G for incorporating support for Discord, OBS, and Overwolf in the <em>Actions</em> submenu, which allowed me to precisely allocate my streaming and audio preferences without any unnecessary time wastage.</p>



<h3 id="logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-performance">Logitech G Pro X Superlight: Performance</h3>



<p>The Pro X Superlight&rsquo;s Hero sensor sports impressive specs, offering everything a pro gamer would want. That includes a max resolution of 25,600 DPI, tracking speed of 400 inches per second (IPS), and a polling rate of 1000Hz (ms).</p>



<p>Taking the mouse for a play test yielded excellent results. The sensor tracked really well, precisely keeping pace with my movements in games like <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em>. Of course, as impressive as it was, it&rsquo;s just one feature in a panoply of factors that make this mouse a top-notch performer.</p>



<p>The Pro X Superlight&rsquo;s buttery-smooth movement, for one, plays a huge part. This mouse glides across your mouse mat perfectly, which I put down to its well-placed PTFE feet as well as its sheer lightness.</p>



<p>On the underside, there&rsquo;s a big chunk of PTFE up front and another ring of it around the cap over the dongle storage alcove at the back end. If you want even quicker movement, however, you need only swap out that default cap for the one in the box which is entirely covered in PTFE.<br /></p>



<p>Being so lightweight, the Pro X Superlight makes full use of the sensor&rsquo;s capabilities, allowing you to abandon heavy, full-hand movements for lighter, more precise ones. It can at times feel like you&rsquo;re not moving much at all, but surprisingly you&rsquo;re still actually having a big impact in your game. In fact, you can be very precise with hardly any effort.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1475710" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Underside.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Well-placed PTFE feet ensure the X Superlight glides over your mouse mat effortlessly.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Pro X Superlight&rsquo;s precision is enhanced by the mouse&rsquo;s symmetrical design, which allows you to easily predict where your curser is. This made it a cinch to win &lsquo;Last Chance&rsquo; scenarios in the game <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em>, thereby allowing me to keep my character alive for longer. The buttons deserve praise too. They feel very soft and actuate with the lightest pressure.</p>



<p>With my device&rsquo;s buttons up to the task of registering the fastest possible clicks, the emphasis was put back on my fingers to respond in like. And, after a while, I trained myself to make quicker clicks. It&rsquo;s rare to find a mouse that challenges you like that&mdash;which is another reason I found this mouse such a pleasure to use.</p>



<h3 id="should-you-buy-the-logitech-g-pro-x-superlight">Should you buy the Logitech G Pro X Superlight?</h3>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a refined and attractive pro-grade gaming mouse that lives up to expectations and always delivers consistent performance, then it&rsquo;s hard to look past the Logitech G Pro X Superlight for your next gaming session.</p>

<p>With soaring cloud revenues, plunging Windows and device revenues, and a few days into a substantial layoff, Microsoft&rsquo;s first-quarter results feel a bit like a quote from Dickens.</p>



<p>The best of times: &ldquo;The next major wave of computing is being born,&rdquo; as Microsoft reported 31 percent revenue growth in its Intelligent Cloud business, a day after <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1481398/chatgpt-may-charge-42-mo-for-a-paid-tier-as-microsoft-invests-again.html">Microsoft invested again in OpenAI</a> and its chat service, ChatGPT. (ChatGPT will run on top of Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure cloud.) The worst of times: Windows OEM revenue sank 39 percent, thanks to a tanking PC market; Microsoft&rsquo;s Devices (Surface) revenue fell the same amount, thanks to issues launching products, reduced demand, and success a year ago.</p>



<p>In the end, it all sort of came out in the wash, however, with net income down 12 percent to $16.4 billion and revenue sinking 2 percent to $52.7 billion. Microsoft reported $14.2 billion in revenue in More Personal Computing, its consumer business, down 19 percent, but 18 percent growth to $21.5 billion in Intelligent Cloud and 7 percent growth in Productivity and Business Processes, Microsoft&rsquo;s Office business.</p>



<p>For Microsoft&rsquo;s consumer business, however, the quarter was one of Microsoft&rsquo;s worst. Not only did Devices (formerly called Surface) revenue sink by more than it has in years, Microsoft said that the company had problems launching certain undisclosed Surface devices. (Devices also includes the Xbox, HoloLens, Surface Duo, and its peripherals.) Xbox hardware revenue sank by 13 percent, too. According to Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood, the drop in Windows OEM revenue was expected, thanks to a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470576/1470576.html">drop in PC sales</a> that Gartner ranked as the worst ever. </p>



<p>Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella focused on the long-term positives, saying that &ldquo;the next major wave of computing is being born as we turn the world&rsquo;s most advanced AI models into a new computing platform.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The age of AI is upon us and Microsoft is powering it,&rdquo; Nadella added. </p>



<p>Nadella also said that Microsoft would be applying AI to its Power platform, which allows those with no knowledge of coding to code apps through a visual user interface. &ldquo;We are making it easier for anyone to streamline repetitive tasks introducing new AI powered features to turn natural language prompts into complex workflows,&rdquo; Nadella said.</p>



<p>Microsoft, however, believes that the Windows OEM license sales and Surface devices will see &ldquo;continued declines,&rdquo; Hood said, with expected revenue of $11.9 to $12.3 billion, down from the current quarter. Devices revenue should decline in &ldquo;the mid 40s, as we work through the execution challenges noted earlier,&rdquo; Hood said, meaning that a forecasted drop of more than 40 percent in the Devices business would be more than the current quarter, too. Xbox revenue should also decline in the single digits, Hood said, and Windows OEM revenue should continue to drop in the &ldquo;high 30s,&rdquo; Hood said, or just under 40 percent.</p>



<p>Microsoft did not disclose which Surface devices failed to meet expectations, though there were only a few to choose from: the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html">Surface Pro 9, in either a 5G ARM model</a> or with a Core chip inside; the Surface Studio 2+; and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357810/microsoft-surface-laptop-5-review-for-surface-fans-only.html">Surface Laptop 5</a>. None, though, differed that substantially from their predecessors.</p>



<p>Revenue in Microsoft&rsquo;s Productivity and Business Processes, however, should be up between 11 and 13 percent, Hood added, driven by Office 365.</p>



<p>Microsoft is &ldquo;continuing to work towards closing&rdquo; its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605846/microsoft-hopes-to-buy-activision-blizzard-in-a-deal-that-would-make-gaming-history.html">Activision acquisition</a>, Hood added.</p>
