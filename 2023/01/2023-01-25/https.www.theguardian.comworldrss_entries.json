I\u2019ve been on the record saying, well, I think we have to change the attitudes across our country, it won\u2019t matter what day.</p><p><strong>We ought to be proud of our country at some point in a united way.</strong> <strong>And whether it\u2019s the 26th of January or another day, that\u2019s something that our country has to mature and grow towards.</strong></p><p><em>[I\u2019m] disappointed. For a couple of reasons: if we look at the United Nations declaration of Indigenous peoples ... nothing in the declaration undermines the authority of the state, the country\u2019s government. In Australia we did not cede ownership of Australia. Regrettably, it was determined by the British on the day, that terra nullius existed in Australia, which was overturned in 1992 through the Mabo high court decision ... whilst we haven\u2019t ceded ... we haven\u2019t progressed that matter.</em></p><p><em>It\u2019s important that we as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have an opportunity to be able to contribute to policies that impact us, and programs and legislation \u2013 and that\u2019s the first step. And we\u2019ll go down and address the other matters, truth-telling is already progressing, treaty, although some states already looking at treaties within their own jurisdictions. <strong>So, I feel a bit offended when we\u2019re starting to determine that the support or determination of whether to support a voice is predetermined by whether you address some of the other issues in Indigenous affairs</strong>. As I said in my speech last night, they can co-exist, these approaches. If you support the principle of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having input into policy and legislation, that\u2019s what you should support - it shouldn\u2019t be predicated on whether other things are happening.</em></p> <a
