Director Anthony Chen\u2019s film, from a screenplay by Susanne Farrell and Alexander Maksik, gives harried aftermath the sheen of tranquil nobility, resilience hiding in plain sight \u2013 the crowd of barely clothed, languid white bodies dotting star Cynthia Erivo\u2019s opening walk down the beach, the bleached yellow of the Mediterranean sun, the way Erivo\u2019s Jacqueline slowly, carefully washes her one set of clothes. Even Jacqueline\u2019s night ritual, arranging plastic bags of pebbles for a makeshift beach cave mattress, takes on the lulling rhythm of a reverie.</p><p>It\u2019s a lot of compelling aesthetic, anchored at most turns by Erivo\u2019s committed, tense performance, that like many a Sundance movie can only cover so much undercooked structure. Drift, based on Maksik\u2019s 2013 novel A Marker to Measure Drift, relies on Jacqueline\u2019s trauma-fragmented memory to unfold the story too slowly. For the first half hour, Jacqueline is mostly a cipher, scrounging for money via beachside foot massages by day, flitting through shadows and dodging bigoted police by night. We catch tantalizing snippets of her clearly suppressed past in too-short flashbacks \u2013 a time when she had long braids and a white British girlfriend (Honor Swinton Byrne), a time when she lived in England, a joyful moment with her privileged minister\u2019s family in militarized Liberia. The script\u2019s spareness \u2013 what year is it? How did Jacqueline get here?

At Sundance in 2020, Dee Rees followed Pariah and Mudbound with a clunky, critically loathed attempt to turn Joan Didion\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/28/the-last-thing-he-wanted-review-misfiring-anne-hathaway-thriller\">The Last Thing He Wanted</a> into a coherent film. And just last year Andrew Dominik and Noah Baumbach made their worst films to date with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/08/blonde-review-some-like-it-rotten-monroe-biopic-is-moving-explicit-and-intensely-irritating\">Blonde</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/03/white-noise-review-noah-baumbach-don-delillo-adaptation-adam-driver-greta-gerwig\">White Noise</a> respectively.</p><p>A strong attachment to the source material can of course be a good thing, a passion that can be clearly felt on screen, but it can also cloud one\u2019s vision resulting in a messy, no-notes-taken blank cheque project that can often affect what cheques might follow. The latest victim is Cory Finley, who at the intimidatingly young age of 32, has already made two festival hits: dark teen comedy Thoroughbreds and knotty true crime drama Bad Education, featuring a never-better Hugh Jackman. But his third film is a bafflingly botched misfire, a frustratingly off-key adaptation of MT Anderson\u2019s 2017 novel Landscape with Invisible Hand. What makes it that much more frustrating is that it\u2019s not made without visible skill and there are some moving parts that are close to fully working but those that don\u2019t quickly outnumber, a film that gets harder to defend with every scene.</p><p>Landscape with Invisible Hand premiered at the Sundance film festival and will be released later this year</p> <a
