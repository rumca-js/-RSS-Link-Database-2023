This move came despite concerns that the tanks are too difficult for Ukrainian troops to operate and maintain.</p><p>Germany is also sending 14 Leopard 2 A6 tanks, and European allies in total have sent enough tanks to equip two Ukrainian tank battalions. Germany only agreed to send the tanks if the United States did too, due to the possibility of a less-than-amicable reaction from Russia. It's like playing chicken, except instead of avoiding a car, it's nuclear war. Po-tay-to, po-tah-to. </p><p>This all sounds pretty scary. But don't worry! Our fearless leader <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/biden-border-gaffes" target="_blank">Joseph Robinette Biden</a> assured us this move is not by any means an escalation, saying, “It is not an offensive threat to Russia. There is no offensive threat to Russia. If Russian troops return to Russia, where they belong, this war would be over today.” Nothing says "not a threat" like shipping massive weapons of war to your enemy's border. </p><p>If this isn't enough to inspire confidence in our commander-in-chief, Biden also mistakenly referred to "Ukraine's brutal aggression" that's "happening because of Russia." Oy vey. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Biden then forgot the name of the "Secretary of Defense" and instead said "Secretary of Military," then almost called him "Speaker." </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>There are also concerns from U.S. officials over the difficulty in training Ukrainians to operate the tanks. John Kirby, the National Security Council strategic communications coordinator, explained that the United States does not dictate how the Ukrainians use the weapons provided, saying "this is their country, their war."  <br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cKIRBY: "We do not dictate to the Ukrainians how they operate, where they operate, what targets they choose...These are their decisions to make...It is their country, their war."\u201d</div> — Daily Caller (@Daily Caller)

</blockquote>
<p>Right, it's Ukraine's war...it's just funded by billions and billions of American tax dollars, and the United States is there to ensure it's "prosecuted successfully." Oh and we might put up a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/south-carolina-republican-congressman-introduces-resolution-place-zelenskyy-bust-us-capitol" target="_blank">bust</a> of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the United States Capitol, just for fun. But it's <em>totally</em> Ukraine's war. </p><p><p>

## Watch: Drama queen Eric Swalwell accuses Kevin McCarthy of trying to have him killed

Or for farting on live television. House Majority Leader <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kevin-mccarthy-reporter" target="_blank">Kevin McCarthy</a> rejected Swalwell's appointment to the House Intelligence Committee. Probably due to all the Chinese spy banging. That's typically frowned upon from a national security standpoint. </p><p>In his rejection letter, McCarthy wrote, "I cannot simply recognize years of service as the sole criteria for membership on this essential committee. Integrity matters more."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cI have rejected the appointments of Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell for the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nI am committed to returning the @HouseIntel Committee to one of genuine honesty and credibility that regains the trust of the American people.\u201d</div> — Kevin McCarthy (@Kevin McCarthy)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/1618047779422769154">1674607627</a>
</blockquote>
<p>In light of this, Swalwell politely accepted McCarthy's decision, quietly packed up his things, and went on home. </p><p>Just kidding. </p><p>He actually claimed on national television that Kevin McCarthy is trying to have him killed. Yes, we are talking about the same Kevin McCarthy. Doesn't exactly scream "cold-blooded assassin." </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Swalwell said, <em>"The cost are the death threats that Ms. Omar and myself and Mr. Schiff keep getting because Mr. McCarthy continues to aim and project these smears against us. Even though we have said publicly, these smears are bringing death threats, he continues to do it, which makes us believe that <strong>there's an intent behind it.</strong>" </em></p><p>Swalwell went on to issue a veiled threat against McCarthy: <em>"But we will not be quiet, we are not going away. I think he'll regret giving all three of us more time."</em></p><p>Swalwell actually tweeted out a death threat he claims is inspired by Kevin McCarthy, though the caller never mentioned McCarthy's name. I'm also not sure how denying a representative a committee appointment would directly cause death threats. Seems a bit like grasping for straws, no?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cNEW @SpeakerMcCarthy-inspired death threat. \n\nYou know, Kevin, every time you lie about me \u2014 even after the @washingtonpost  gives you 4 Pinocchios for your lies \u2014 death threats like this flood in.\u201d</div> — Rep. Eric Swalwell (@Rep. Eric Swalwell)

</blockquote>
<p>I personally haven't heard of any "smears" from Kevin McCarthy, other than his explanation that representatives can't bang spies for our foreign adversaries and expect to get off scot-free. That's just the way the fortune cookie crumbles. </p><p><p>

## Dave Chappelle's latest (spot-on) anti-woke comments won't win him any friends: 'They want you to fear them'

Yes, I'm just learning this myself too. On last night's episode of <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/25/dave-chappelle-rips-trans-activists-using-violence-to-protest-him/" target="_blank">The Midnight Miracle</a></em>, Chappelle discussed the concert he was SUPPOSED to have at a Minneapolis club made popular by Prince. But, you know...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="c2fce" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32903367&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Dave Chappelle released a comedy special called The Closer<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-emmy-nomination" target="_blank"> that got nominated for an Emmy</a>. Transactivists and other woke twats claimed without evidence that the special was "transphobic." Bing bang boom. Chappelle was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-first-avenue" target="_blank">supposed to perform at Prince's club</a>. A small minority of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-variety-theater" target="_blank">loud people got the show canceled</a>. Chappelle moved to a bigger venue <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-protesters" target="_blank">and the protests moved there</a>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="9f476" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32903372&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Chappelle pointed out that while <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-supporters" target="_blank">his diverse group of fans showed the protestors nothing but love</a>, the woke activists (regularly pandered to by the Democrats and the media) cursed and screamed at his audience members. They threw eggs at them. One woman even picked up a police barricade and threw that. Chappelle was surprised by that one because it was an amazing feat of strength for a woman.</p><blockquote>One of the things that these people, the trans and their surrogates, always say is that my jokes are somehow gonna be the root cause of some impending violence. But I gotta tell you, as abrasive as [the activists] were — the way they were protesting, throwing eggs at people, throwing barricades, cussing and screaming — nobody beat ’em up.</blockquote><p>Yes, as per usual, the people who claim words are violence engage in actual violence to prevent you from saying words. The irony is lost on them. Also, the irony is violence.</p><p>The people throwing eggs and barricades claim to be on the side of love. Nope.</p><blockquote>They want to be feared. If you say this, then we will punish you — we will come to … f*ck your show up. And they just don’t get to do that to me.</blockquote><p>They shouldn't get away with doing that to anyone. But <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-royalties" target="_blank">like JK Rowling</a>, Chappelle has a pile of f*ck you money which makes him uncancellable. </p><p><p>

## Surprise! ANTIFA members behind Jane's Revenge attacks on  pregnancy centers

Because nothing quite sends the message, "you <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=abortion" target="_blank">pro-lifers</a> only care about the baby until it's born" like...destroying the places that help care for the babies after they're born? Rock-solid logic, as per usual. </p><p>Anyway. There has been noticeably little action from federal law enforcement on these attacks - until now. The Department of Justice indicted Florida residents Caleb Freestone, 27, and Amber Smith-Stewart, 23, on charges of a civil rights conspiracy and for violating the FACE Act. They face up to 12 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and up to $350,000 in fines.</p><p>The attack in question was on a pregnancy resource center in Winter Haven, Florida,  coordinated by the group "Jane's Revenge." Oh, and Freestone and Smith-Stewart are also <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/atlanta-mayor-speaks-violence" target="_blank">ANTIFA</a> members. Imagine my shock. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cBreaking: Two Florida #Antifa members have been federally indicted for their alleged roles in an attack on a Winter Haven, Fla. pregnancy resource center by "Jane's Revenge." Following the overturning of Roe v Wade, far-left cells activated to attack churches & pregnancy centers.\u201d</div> — Andy Ng\u00f4 \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@Andy Ng\u00f4 \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1618054877455986688">1674609319</a>
</blockquote>
<p>The defendants allegedly vandalized the resource center with spray-painted threats in June. The graffiti <a href="https://www.theledger.com/story/news/local/2022/06/27/winter-haven-florida-lifechoice-pregnancy-center-vandalized-graffiti-janes-revenge/7744257001/" target="_blank">reportedly</a> read, "Your time is up," "We're coming for U," "Jane's revenge," "If abortions aren’t safe then neither [sic] are you" and "We are everywhere." </p><p>The indictment also alleges they violated the FACE Act by using threats of force to intimidate the workers of the pregnancy resource facility, as well as by intentionally damaging and destroying the facility’s property. </p><p>The FACT Act, short for Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, "prohibits threats of force, obstruction and property damage intended to interfere with reproductive health care services." </p><p>Though the phrase "reproductive health care" has been co-opted to mean "vicious baby murder," the bill is not just about abortion. It "protects all patients, providers, and facilities that provide reproductive health services, including pro-life pregnancy counseling services and any other pregnancy support facility providing reproductive health care," according to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/protecting-patients-and-health-care-providers" target="_blank">DOJ</a>. </p><p>Jane's Revenge also took responsibility for attacks on at least <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/zero-arrests-16-janes-revenge-attacks-pro-life-organizations" target="_blank">16</a> other pregnancy centers. So get to work, DOJ! Lots of ANTIFAs to round up. </p><p><p>

## Watch: Training video illustrates how to push radical gender theory on four-year-olds and brag about it

You've got the beach, mountains, history, and nice weather. Oh, and they're <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/karine-jean-pierre-florida-history" target="_blank">teaching</a> toddlers radical gender theory. Because of course. </p><p>The North Carolina Association for the Education of Young Children has a documentary titled, "Reflecting on Anti-bias Education in Action: The Early Years." It includes a scene where young children are given a lesson from their "non-binary" teacher. The documentary was reportedly shown to North Carolina daycare owners at a training given by the North Carolina Association for the Education of Young Children. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThis was shown to daycare owners in NC. \n\nA teacher used a doll to teach gender identity to 4-5 year olds. \n\nWhen a child brings up \u201cnon-binary,\u201d the teachers say it\u2019s \u201ca huge testament to how much we\u2019ve been talking about it in the classroom\u201d & \u201cit\u2019s constantly in conversation\u201d\u201d</div> — Jordan Chamberlain (@Jordan Chamberlain)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/jordylancaster/status/1617986151931084801">1674592934</a>
</blockquote>
<p>The teacher showed the kids a doll named "Nash" and told them Nash is not a boy or a girl, but "just a kid." One genius four-year-old replied that kids can be boys or girls. But another chimed in that Nash could be "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nonbinary-rubber-torso" target="_blank">non-binary</a>," which made the teachers in the film ecstatic. </p><p>One teacher commented, "I think it was a huge testament to how much we’ve been talking about it in the classroom. You never mentioned the term ‘non-binary,’ it was a child who brought that up because it’s constantly in conversation." Oh, I'm sure it is. What else would you talk to four-year-olds about, if not sexuality and gender? </p><p>The nonbinary teacher further explained to the very-confused children, "Just like me, Nash is non-binary, so they are not sure if they are a boy or a girl, so when people ask them are you a boy or a girl, right now they just feel like saying, ‘I am a kid,’ while they are figuring it out.’” </p><p>She also corrected one child's pronoun usage to the totally sensical "they" instead of "he." Because people identifying as more than one person is completely normal and actually you're a bigot if you think that's weird. Probably racist too. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

It's been ever since he became our new <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/konstantin-kisin-woke-culture" target="_blank">anti-woke hero with a ten-minute debate takedown</a>. Kisin is a satirist and podcaster from Russia who currently resides in the UK. This clip from an Australian talk show caught my attention, where Kisin shares how many people were arrested for social media posts in Britain vs. in Russia last year.</p><p>He doesn't provide his sources, so we'll label this somewhere between "claims without evidence" and "whoa if true." I'm a blogger and not a journalismer. I like sharing things I find interesting.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Here <a href="https://twitter.com/KonstantinKisin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KonstantinKisin</a> explains that with a population of 146 million, Russia arrested 400 people last year for social media posts.<br /><br />Britain's population is 70 million, 3,300. <a href="https://t.co/6MKSl8kpmE">pic.twitter.com/6MKSl8kpmE</a><br />— David Atherton (@DaveAtherton20) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveAtherton20/status/1617455566116233216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>In Russia last year, 400 people were arrested last year for this they said on social media. Obviously, this country is very different. How many people do you think were arrested in Britain for things they said on social media last year? 3300.</blockquote><p>If the calculator I used on the internet is correct, that's 725% more people arrested in Britain than in Russia. Over speech. Britain, an alleged place of freedom, vs. Russia, a country not known for allowing their people to have any freedom ever.</p><p>The only British example that came to Kisin's mind was from 2018, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/in-the-uk-woman-guilty-of-racism-for-posting-rap-lyrics" target="_blank">and a story we covered here on the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website</a>. A girl, in tribute to a friend who died, posted the lyrics to the friend's favorite rap song. Someone complained about her social media post because it contained a few instances of the no-no word. The girl got arrested and convicted of being racist. over song lyrics.</p><p>More to Kisin's point, in 2022 we've seen people in the UK get arrested for social media posts that "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/social-media-post-man-arrested" target="_blank">caused someone anxiety</a>." Another woman <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/police-arrest-woman-memes" target="_blank">was arrested in front of her children</a> over memes she tweeted.</p><p>Australia isn't much better. Australians got arrested <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/australia-activist-arrested" target="_blank">for having opinions</a> that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/australia-police-arrest-pregant-woman" target="_blank">con</a><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/australia-police-arrest-pregant-woman" target="_blank">tradicted the government's public health orders.</a></p><p>I'd be curious to see where Kisin got his data from. On the surface, it appears in Putin's controlled Russia citizens are freer to speak than British citizens are in what used to be considered the "free world." </p><p>It's another "Pay Attention, America" moment. Progressive leaders in our country believe all the same things progressive leaders in the UK do. And they'll attempt to get away with the same things if we ever let them.</p><p><p>

## Mark Hamill, to no one's surprise, clarifies liking a JK Rowling tweet and his excuse doesn't make a lick of sense

Even more predictable than the entire third Star Wars trilogy. Mark Hamill has an excuse for liking a JK Rowling tweet and wants to ensure everyone he is every bit the woke douche you want him to be.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mark-hammil-jk-rowling-tweet" target="_blank">Quick recap</a>. The actor LIKED a Rowling tweet. He didn't retweet it or respond to it. He only pressed the "like" button." Yes, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-scotland-march-activist" target="_self">THAT JK Rowling</a>. The <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/harry-potter-book-name-removed" target="_self">Head Transphobe in Charge</a>. Here's the tweet.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Citation needed. <a href="https://t.co/phsneRp9hZ">pic.twitter.com/phsneRp9hZ</a><br />— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1617223771722579970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Woke-Not Fun To Be Around-No One Like You Twitter went bananas over it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Mark Hamill likes a tweet of J.K. Rowling and the internet loses their minds as usual. Claiming he has done this once before so this isn’t an accident and he obviously supports transphobia. <br /><br />These people need to go outside more… <a href="https://t.co/G09uPjzyQs">pic.twitter.com/G09uPjzyQs</a><br />— MasteroftheTDS (@MasteroftheTDS) <a href="https://twitter.com/MasteroftheTDS/status/1617598542390099969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>So Luke had to reassure everyone he doesn't believe in science and biology like they don't. He claims what he liked about the  exchange "was someone speaking their truth to power." Someone's "truth" is woke-eese to mean "their opinion." The actor also blamed Twitter for being no place for nuance. </p><p>He ten makes it abundantly clear: "I support human rights for EVERYONE, regardless of their gender identity, PERIOD."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a41ca" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32901680&amp;width=980" />
</p><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">What I "liked" about this exchange was someone speaking their truth to power. Twitter is, unfortunately, no place for nuance.<br />It's imperative I make this abundantly clear: I support human rights for EVERYONE, regardless of their gender identity, PERIOD. <a href="https://t.co/eqQxuaZiss">https://t.co/eqQxuaZiss</a><br />— Mark Hamill (@MarkHamill) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkHamill/status/1618012349516115968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Here's the thing: whose truth to what power is Hamill liking? Someone who was not born a woman claimed to be more of a woman than someone who has fifty-seven years of experience in the area of womanhood. I know progressives don't follow the science or the biology, but the math here is clear.</p><p>And if he's following India's "truth," he should have liked her tweet. Not JK Rowling's response that makes India look silly. To the untrained eye, it appears as if Hamill LIKES India being made to look silly. I must not understand nuance.</p><p>I don't think Hamill's excuse is pure enough. He needs to beg more and cut a sizable check to a nonprofit. It's the only way to make things right.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Kevin McCarthy DE-STROYS smug reporter after kicking Dems off committee and I never knew he had it in him

We'll discuss it after. But ask yourself a question. Do we get this McCarthy if not for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-gaetz-chip-roy-speaker" target="_blank">Chip Roy</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kevin-mccarthy-cuts-deal" target="_blank">Matt Gaetz</a> shoving his head in a toilet for a few days? I'm not sure...</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Holy shit. Kevin McCarthy just absolutely destroyed a reporter who questioned his decision to remove Schiff and Swalwell from the intel committee. <br /><br />Total annihilation. <br /> <a href="https://t.co/bIAhpkiG8Q">pic.twitter.com/bIAhpkiG8Q</a><br />— Greg Price (@greg_price11) <a href="https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1618061588375932929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Let me be very clear and respectful to you.

</p>
<p>Here's what happened. McCarthy yeeted Rep. Adam Schitt and Rep. Eric Swallows off of the Intel Committee. Actually, yeeted might be the wrong word. They were nominated to be a part of the committee by the Democrat Minority Leader and McCarthy said, "Nope."</p><p>Critics say both men were compromised when it comes to US Intelligence. Schitt was rejected after using his position as Chairman to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adam-schiff-view-steele-dossier" target="_blank">push the Russian collusion hoax</a> used to impeach a president. Swallows was compromised after putting <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ted-cruz-chinese-communist-georgia" target="_blank">his d*ck in a Chinese spy</a> allegedly. Speaker McCarthy cited the Nancy Pelosi standard that "<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/01/25/mccarthy-blocks-schiff-and-swalwell-from-taking-intel-committee-seats/?sh=77af14a6223f" target="_blank">integrity matters more</a>" than partisanship to say both congressmen are unfit to serve on the Intel Committee.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I have rejected the appointments of Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell for the House Intelligence Committee.<br /><br />I am committed to returning the <a href="https://twitter.com/HouseIntel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HouseIntel</a> Committee to one of genuine honesty and credibility that regains the trust of the American people. <a href="https://t.co/ePxlbanxta">pic.twitter.com/ePxlbanxta</a><br />— Kevin McCarthy (@SpeakerMcCarthy) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/1618047779422769154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The reporter's argument is the same argument reporters are going to be using for the next two years no matter the issue or situation, "Yeah, but what about George Santos?" Santos is the GOP rep who lied about *waves hands* all of it. And <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/george-santos-brazil" target="_blank">MAY have been a drag queen</a>, a charge Santos denies. He claims he just dressed up as a woman on occasion.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="d04c8" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32901303&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>The reporter's argument is because Santos is allowed on the Small Business Committee and the Science, Space and Technology Committee, it is hypocritical to not let Schitt and Swallows on a committee that gives them access to vital US Intelligence they have both proven they aren't grown up enough to handle. </p><p>Speaker McCarthy believes that argument is dumb. He expressed so with great aplomb. We never knew he had it in him.</p><p><p>
