It depends when you count\nfrom, and it's hard to pick any specific day or event because it\ncoalesced out of a lot of different strands.  Plus, since this is a\nmovement and not just an idea, it matters when it started gathering\npeople which is naturally very fuzzy.  Roughly, I'd describe the\nprogression as something like:\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/how-much-does-ea-exist-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"310\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/how-much-does-ea-exist.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAt the beginning of 2008 there wasn't an EA movement yet, while by\n2012 there was one. There wasn't an instantaneous change.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhy this particular curve?  Here are some historical points that\nanchor it to events:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>In March 2012, <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/a-name-for-a-movement\">I\nwrote</a> \"there's a young movement that combines the idea of a\nduty to help others with the idea that you should maximize the impact\nof your actions,\" as part of trying to figure out what we should call\nEA.  I'd say it 100% existed by this point, and I wasn't \"calling\nit\"&#8212;it existed before here.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>In November 2011, 80,000 Hours <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170318035201/http://rjshade.com/2011/11/22/80000-Hours/\">launched</a>.\nIt was mostly a way of spreading ideas that were already popular in\nthe Oxford community and online, so I'd also say the EA movement\nexisted before this.  It's a bit less clear than when you have people\nliterally calling it a movement, though.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>In December 2010, Roko Mijic ran a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4amcyxad5bnBR9Afm/usd100-for-the-best-article-on-efficient-charity-deadline\">contest</a>\non LessWrong for the best explanation of EA, which Scott Alexander won\nwith his essay, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pC47ZTsPNAkjavkXs/efficient-charity-do-unto-others\">Efficient\nCharity: Do Unto Others...</a>.  Jonah Sinick also wrote a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FCxHgPsDScx4C3H8n/efficient-charity\">detailed\nentry</a>, and Mass_Driver <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4amcyxad5bnBR9Afm/usd100-for-the-best-article-on-efficient-charity-deadline?commentId=4XCgcmFrsRzNoD3KC\">contributed\none as well</a>.  This feels very movementy to me: a bunch of people\nworking together to put some shared ideas into a form where they'll be\nable to spread better.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>In November 2009, the first 30 people <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members\">joined Giving\nWhat We Can</a>.  A group of people pledging to do something seems\nlike part of a movement.  At the time GWWC was <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/gwwc-pledge-history\">specific to global poverty</a>, however,\nso I wouldn't fully count this.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Over the course of 2009, discussion on the Felicifia forum (<a href=\"https://felicifia.github.io/forum/index.html\">archive</a>)\nstarted to feel like an early EA community.  For example, see thread\non <a href=\"https://felicifia.github.io/thread/79.html\">charity\nchoice</a> and the <a href=\"https://felicifia.github.io/forum/23.html\">applied ethics</a>\nand <a href=\"https://felicifia.github.io/forum/25.html\">philanthropy</a>\nboards.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>In December 2006, the first GiveWell <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2006/12/23/nice-to-meet-you/\">blog\npost</a> comes out.  Looking back at it, and their other early posts,\nyou can tell that Holden and Elie had a lot of what has since become\nEA in mind.  This also goes for a lot of other early writing like Nick\nBostrom's 2003 post on <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste\">astronomical\nwaste</a>, Anand's 2003 <a href=\"https://archive.is/4d9oC\">SL4\n\"EffectiveAltruism\" wiki entry</a>, Brian Tomasik's 2006 post on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080517114312/http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html\">earning\nto give</a>, and Eliezer Yudkowsky's 2007 post on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy/scope-insensitivity\">scope\ninsensitivity</a> (that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9a7xMXoSiQs3EYPA2/the-history-of-the-term-effective-altruism?commentId=QhLrHR6B33qHsadhi\">coincidentally</a>\nused the term \"effective altruist\" years before it was <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9a7xMXoSiQs3EYPA2/the-history-of-the-term-effective-altruism\">settled\non</a>).  These are helpful for dating the ideas, but I'm looking for\nwhen the ideas started gathering people and they seem to predate most\nof that.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nOne thing I'm not putting much weight on here is the founding dates of\norganizations.  While many EA orgs have played a large role in the EA\nmovement, the oldest became EA over time instead of starting out that\nway.  For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute\">MIRI</a>\nwas founded in ~2000 as SIAI, but was initially wasn't something you'd\nrecognize as EA and didn't have an associated community.  It did grow\nin both of these directions over time, but to the extent that this\nhelps us figure out the timeline of the movement we need to look at\nthose later developments.  Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Charity_Evaluators\">ACE</a>\ncould (but doesn't!) claim to have been founded in 2010 as <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100917130751/http://www.justiceforanimals.net/\">JFA</a>,\nbut before <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/about/background/our-history/\">merging\nwith</a> 80k's <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/08/project-launch-effective-animal-activism/\">EAA</a>\nit had a pretty different focus.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid033Fhix3vp6vJHdHqmkaabEche6cdBjRYCk4LitvVxgzR8eWNVCw4MCDwiFicCG1MAl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/uEBBFbgPNAB2zr9sm\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/uitxF9dczuqpkwszJ\">the EA Forum</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109750292032575028\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Jeff Kaufmann"}}
