  <p id="stHoIk">West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin (D) introduced a new bill that would halt the current electric vehicle tax credit until strict new battery requirements are put in place. It’s the latest move by the conservative Democrat to limit the government’s ability to incentivize car buyers to shift to less polluting vehicles. </p>
<p id="XLPZYj">Manchin, who had a hand last year in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/28/23282156/ev-tax-credit-used-vehicle-senate-deal-schumer-manchin">crafting the EV tax credit</a> that was included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), placed the blame on the Internal Revenue Service for blowing past its December 31st, 2022 deadline to release guidance on the battery requirements. </p>

  <p id="cRna0G">Tech companies — including Twitter — are following the Indian government’s demands to suppress a BBC documentary critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/01/24/twitter-elon-musk-modi-india-bbc/">reported by <em>The Intercept</em></a> and <em>TechCrunch</em>, Twitter and YouTube both locally blocked <em>The Modi Question</em>, which investigates claims of Modi’s involvement in India’s deadly 2002 Gujarat riots. It’s one of Twitter’s first tangles with India under the ownership of billionaire Elon Musk, but <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/01/24/twitter-elon-musk-modi-india-bbc/">contrary to some writing</a>, the documentary’s ban isn’t an example of Musk violating a vocal “free speech absolutist” ethos. It’s a reminder that Musk has always been fine with government censorship.</p>
<p id="uXARRT">Over the weekend, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting senior advisor Kanchan Gupta <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/KanchanGupta/status/1616745170183278592">tweeted that both...</a></p>

  <p id="GMuvkH">Amid flagging demand, steep price cuts, and ongoing drama surrounding Elon Musk’s stewardship of Twitter, Tesla published its fourth quarter earnings report in which the company said it earned $3.7 billion in net income on $24.3 billion in revenue. That represents a 59 percent increase year over year compared to $2.8 billion in revenue in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22903136/tesla-q4-earnings-profit-chip-shortage-cybertruck-elon-musk">Q4 2021</a>. </p>
<p id="Sb6Cg6">It was also Tesla’s third year ending in the black, with $14.1 billion in net income for 2022, compared to $5.5 billion in profit in 2021 and a mere $721 million in 2020. Tesla turned that profit on over $81.5 billion in revenue. </p>

Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/01/25/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25284/">announced on Wednesday</a> that there’s now a preview version of the app in the Microsoft Store with support for the widget system, letting you see your latest messages right from the widget tray.</p>
<p id="Rs5lAf">The widget doesn’t appear to be available unless you’re running the latest Insider Preview build, so most people won’t be able to try it out just yet. If you are, it may be a bit of a spotty experience — Microsoft says the preview has a few known issues where “third-party widgets may occasionally disappear from the widgets board” or get unpinned.</p>

  <p id="FaFPBc">Tesla is investing more than $3.6 billion into its Reno, Nevada Gigafactory, and with part of the cash, it plans to build its “first high-volume Semi factory,” according to <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/continuing-our-investment-nevada">a blog post published Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p id="XpjH5f">The company officially delivered the first of its long-delayed electric Semi trucks to PepsiCo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/1/23488040/tesla-semi-delivery-event-electric-truck-elon-musk">in December</a>, but it appears Tesla is ready to significantly expand its production of the new vehicle. However, Tesla’s blog post doesn’t specify how many trucks the factory might make on a regular basis or when it’s expected to open, so it might be awhile before that high volume kicks in.</p>

## The base M2 14-inch MacBook Pro has an SSD downgrade

  <p id="0QjCSF">The base level 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro reportedly has a slower SSD than its predecessor, according to tests <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/24/macbook-pro-ssd-performance-drop/">done by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>. In BlackMagic’s Disk Speed Test, the 512GB SSD in Apple’s latest flagship achieved read speed scores of around 2,970 MB/s and write speed scores of around 3,150 MB/s, compared to 4,900 MB/s reads and 3,950 MB/s writes that the M1 Pro with a 512GB SSD was capable of.</p>
<p id="epNNVR">That means the 2023 base model has around 39 percent slower reads and 20 percent slower writes than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review">one released in 2021</a>.</p>
<p id="EOCkDG">The reason for the difference is likely down to chips. According to <em>9to5Mac</em>, the 512GB SSD in the previous-gen 14-inch had four NAND storage chips, whereas the one on the M2 Pro seems to have two. Those are obviously...</p>
