It wasn\u2019t just that Clapton was talented; it was that \u2013 uniquely for British rock at the time \u2013 he was the Yardbirds\u2019 star attraction. His presence so obviously overshadowed that of their frontman, Keith Relf, that one of their peers wrote a song about it. Manfred Mann\u2019s The One in the Middle affectionately mocked Relf as \u201cjust a pretty face\u201d. (Curiously, Relf could never be talked into performing it.) Trying to replace Clapton, you might assume, was a hiding to nowhere: anyone who tried was being set up to fail.</p><p>But Jeff Beck, who had been recommended for the job by his friend Jimmy Page, didn\u2019t just replace Clapton. He transformed the Yardbirds, from blues purists struggling to square their love of Buddy Guy and Freddie King with the necessity of having pop hits (Clapton had walked out in protest at the band recording and releasing Graham Gouldman\u2019s For Your Love as a single) to a band at the vanguard of British pop\u2019s relentless forward progress. The first single he recorded with them, Heart Full of Soul, was another Gouldman confection, enlivened by Beck mimicking the sound of sitar \u2013 some months before the Beatles first deployed the instrument on Norwegian Wood \u2013 with a guitar played through a distortion pedal called a Toneblender.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/12/heart-full-of-soul-the-maverick-genius-of-jeff-beck-the-guitarists-guitarist\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/11/england-produce-strong-finish-to-win-series-opener-against-jamaica", "title": "England produce strong finish to win series-opener against Jamaica", "date_published": "2023-01-11 22:28:42+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>England 73-52 Jamaica</li><li>Vitality Roses pull away in fourth quarter in Manchester</li></ul><p>England produced a stunning fourth-quarter display to beat Jamaica 73-52 in Manchester.</p><p>The Vitality Roses were trailing by three points at half-time following a bright start from the Commonwealth Games silver medallists, but Jess Thirlby\u2019s side pulled back after the break.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/11/england-produce-strong-finish-to-win-series-opener-against-jamaica\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/11/nottingham-forest-wolves-carabao-cup-quarter-final-match-report", "title": "Henderson the cup hero for Nottingham Forest in shootout win over Wolves", "date_published": "2023-01-11 22:08:29+00:00", "description": "<p>As I Just Can\u2019t Get Enough blared from the speakers, Nottingham Forest\u2019s players and staff all made a beeline for Dean Henderson.

of Australian suburbia? The protagonist of Michael Cusack\u2019s skittishly entertaining series, Kevin (voiced by Cusack), is a middle-class slob in the familiar ilk of Peter in Family Guy or Homer Simpson. As these things often go, he has a supportive longsuffering wife, Vicky (voiced by Sarah Snook), forever playing second fiddle to her outrageous husband. This balding buffoon sets himself apart from his loafing contemporaries by donning a koala mask and embarking on (mis)adventures as a pseudo crime fighter.</p><p>Kevin is like a less violent version of Rainn Wilson\u2019s unhinged avenger in James Gunn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.flicks.com.au/features/shazam-was-ok-but-the-2010-film-super-is-a-truly-superb-superhero-comedy/\">underrated comedy Super</a>, whose idea of fighting crime is assaulting people who cut in line at the movies. Koala Man\u2019s missions, if you can call them that, tend to be trivial: his first scene shows him clumsily jumping out of a tree then confronting a pair of rough-as-guts derros, Damo and Darren (both also voiced by Cusack), who are merely loitering on the street.

House Republicans will today introduce two measures concerning abortion, one being a bill that \u201csecures medical protections for babies that survive an attempted abortion\u201d, and the other a resolution condemning \u201cattacks on pro-life facilities, groups, and churches\u201d. That the party opposes the procedure is no surprise, but they still have to tread carefully. After all, it was outrage to the supreme court\u2019s decision last year allowing states to ban abortion entirely that led to the GOP\u2019s underperformance in the midterms.

This is the traditionally rackety and roast-comedy style event which has long functioned as a bellwether and curtain-raiser to the Oscars, and whose attenders only recently noticed the ethically compromised and undiverse nature of its presiding body, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. One reason for Hollywood\u2019s lack of outrage, however, could be that the Globes\u2019 actual award results have not, in recent years, been obviously different in terms of levels of diversity from the Oscars\u2019. <br /><br />This year the choices were conservative and safe, and earnestly rewarded excellent mainstream movies \u2013 although probably the most distinctive award, the kind of prize that usually justifies the Globes\u2019 existence, went to SS Rajamouli\u2019s Bollywood smash <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/08/a-biryani-western-on-bhang-rrr-reopens-indian-cinema-in-spectacular-style\">RRR</a>, which won best song for its outrageously enjoyable and spectacular number, Naatu Naatu.<br /><br />But the night belonged to the long-established master and moviegoers\u2019 hero Steven Spielberg and his film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/11/the-fabelmans-review-steven-spielberg-drama\">The Fabelmans</a>, which won best film (drama) and best director. This is a lovely coming-of-age drama with a fictionalised self-portrait of the director as a young man that shows how an American-assimilated Jewish family deals with persistent antisemitism. It\u2019s a study of how a high school kid became obsessed with movies, compulsively shot films with a 16mm camera and then used that skill in reshaping existence to negotiate his place in the world \u2013 generously rising above the bullies, the anxieties and the pain. No one in the industry could have failed to be exalted by the inspired real-life episode towards the end, in which our young hero meets director John Ford: a surprise cameo from another legend.</p><p>It was a triumphant night for Martin McDonagh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/05/the-banshees-of-inisherin-review-martin-mcdonagh\">The Banshees of Inisherin</a>, the Syngeian tragicomedy of a man who rejects his best friend, which carried off best film (musical or comedy) as well as best screenplay and best actor (musical or comedy) for Colin Farrell as the spurned mate.

We can also look at the arrival of the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1994, which made 32-bit processors and rendered 3D visuals the entire focus of the industry, expunging a generation of competing products, from the Philips CD-i to the Atari Jaguar.

Manned entirely by the film-maker, either mounted to his wheelchair or handheld, the camera shows us slivers of the cityscape often missed or unavailable to an able-bodied pedestrian \u2013 the mosaic of sidewalk cracks unspooling under wheels, the brief window of time when the acceleration of a train aligns with Davenport\u2019s chair, the glossy white subway tiles that undulate into an optical illusion when viewed at his pace.
