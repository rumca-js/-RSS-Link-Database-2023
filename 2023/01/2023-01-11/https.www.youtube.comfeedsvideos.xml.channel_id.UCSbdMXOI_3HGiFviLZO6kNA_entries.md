Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news! I recently travelled down to Las Vegas for the 2023 Consumer Electronics Show, basically where almost every company shows off their newest cutting edge electronics and VR had a MASSIVE presence! From HTC Vive's newest XR Elite, to Shiftall and their Flp VR and MeganeX to Pimax and their newest Portal and Crystal.. This year was really an awesome CES for the VR industry and I am glad to be able to show it to you all!
