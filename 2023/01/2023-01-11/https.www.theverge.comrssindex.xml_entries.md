  <p id="esyYnI">Courts have unsealed Google’s motion to dismiss an antitrust lawsuit over its search engine — one that could fracture a core Google service in order to increase online competition. In a motion for summary judgment filed on December 12th, the company argues that the complaint misrepresents its agreements with browser developers and Android phone makers, unfairly punishing its success. “Requiring Google not to compete vigorously — or requiring browser developers to alter their product designs and provide a worse experience for their customers,” it says, “would turn competition law on its head.”</p>

  <p id="GLVRer"><a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/01/in-meeting-reactions-for-google-meet.html">Google is <em>finally</em> rolling out emoji reactions</a> for Meet, something myself and other colleagues have been patiently waiting for since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23002320/google-workspace-meet-emoji-reactions-picture-in-picture-livestream-youtube-spaces">Google announced the feature last year</a>. Now the video conferencing platform will let you silently send out reactions to colleagues during calls.</p>
<p id="TKM0Qt">The emoji don’t stay static like they do on Zoom, though. A line of reactions used during the call will instead float up the left side of the screen and will burst if multiple people use the same ones. Small emoji badges will also appear in the upper-left corner of your video tile, so you’ll get to see who reacted with what. While I haven’t gotten the chance to try it out myself yet, it seems like a fun way to liven up typically routine meetings.</p>

While it’s uncertain whether the devices will actually come to market, Gurman <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1613283005568634892">says in a tweet</a> that we could see a touchscreen MacBook Pro as early as 2025. The report also notes that the screens may use OLED technology, as opposed to the Mini LED displays that are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733122/apple-macbook-pro-mini-led-display-120hz-promotion-refresh-rates">currently in the 14- and 16-inch models</a>.</p>
<p id="uStcUV">The project seems to be in relatively early stages, with engineers being “actively engaged,” according to the report. Gurman says that there are no final plans for launching touchscreen Macs and that plans could always change — we’ve seen Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/6/23542525/apple-iphone-se-4-2024-canceled-rumor-qualcomm">scrap projects</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled">before</a>, and the company has made prototype Macs with touchscreens that never saw the...</p>

  <p id="MuLlWe">Tired of comparing your behind-the-scenes with everyone else’s highlight reel on Instagram? (<a href="https://twitter.com/stevenfurtick/status/67981913746444288?lang=en">To quote Steven Furtick</a>.) The social network has its charms, but for many, it can be a place that’s littered with envy-inducing photos and videos of everybody else’s “perfect” lives. If you’re not careful, it can trigger all sorts of insecurities — sometimes even to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research">detriment of your mental health</a>.</p>
<p id="XsXZav">That’s why it’s important to be mindful of the type of Instagram content you’re consuming on a daily basis. While it’s easy to unfollow accounts from influencers, though, you can’t exactly unfollow or full-on block a friend or a family member without hurting some feelings. That’s where Instagram’s “mute” feature comes in handy: it lets you mute...</p>

  <p id="TDtcaz">Fans of Tsutomu Nihei — the creator of manga and anime series like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/19/15663380/blame-netflix-anime-tsutomu-nihei"><em>Blame!</em></a> and <em>Knights of Sidonia</em> — generally know what to expect from his works. There’s usually a sliver of humanity living perilously in some dark future, an alien or technological force they have to overcome, and all kinds of incredible ships, weapons, and architecture for design nerds to ogle over. They’re the kinds of bleak sci-fi tales that can make you feel small and insignificant. But his latest, called <em>Kaina of the Great Snow Sea</em>, softens things up a little bit.</p>
<p id="TtTuAb">The series, which is on Crunchyroll, once again sees Nihei team up with Polygon Pictures, the animation studio that worked on the <em>Knights of Sidonia</em> series and <em>Blame!</em> film (along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23153217/love-death-robots-very-pulse-machine-interview-emily-dean">my personal favorite...</a></p>

  <p id="lmLQeb">When Tinder launched in 2012, its creators didn’t think much of it. “We put together what would eventually become Tinder in about six to eight weeks and launched it,” says Jonathan Badeen, one of Tinder’s co-founders and inventor of the swipe. The swipe was kind of like Tinder’s secret weapon — it seems obvious now, but a decade ago, swiping transformed mobile dating by turning it into <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/08/past-dates-swapping-notes.html">a kind of game</a>.</p>
<p id="q0bD3R">Swiping was fun and compulsive, keeping users on the app for hours on end. It releases dopamine, a chemical in your brain that gives you a sense of pleasure, which, according to Dinesh Moorjani, another of Tinder’s co-founders, kept users hooked on the platform. “We had some users that were using the app north of 30 to 40 times a day.”</p>

<p id="GV3eAh">Instead, we saw a lot of iterative, predictable evolution of current home theater tech. TCL and Hisense offered up Mini LED TVs with more dimming zones than we’ve ever seen.

  <p id="hCIuxb">ChatGPT is a sensation — but one that’s burning a hole in creator OpenAI’s pocket, with the company thought to be paying <a href="https://twitter.com/tomgoldsteincs/status/1600196995389366274">millions of dollars a month</a> to keep the chatbot free to use. It’s no surprise, then, that as OpenAI <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/01/09/2023/microsoft-eyes-10-billion-bet-on-chatgpt">seeks billions in funding from close partner Microsoft</a>, the company is experimenting with ways to monetize its software.</p>
<p id="Yg5oww">In the official company Discord, OpenAI shared a waitlist for what the company is calling “ChatGPT Professional” — an “experimental” paid version of ChatGPT with all the benefits you’d expect. OpenAI says ChatGPT Professional will be “always available,” offer “fast responses” with no throttling, and give users “at least” twice the daily number of answers compared to the free version of the chatbot. </p>
