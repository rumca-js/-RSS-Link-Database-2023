<p>The PC market collapsed during the fourth quarter of 2022, analysts said, with an unprecedented drop in sales due to inflation and other factors.</p>



<p>IDC reported that PC unit sales fell by 28.1 percent to 67.2 million units, while Gartner said that sales fell by 28.5 percent to 65.3 million units. (IDC is owned by International Data Group [IDG], which owns PCWorld.) According to Gartner, the drop is the largest since the firm began its PC coverage in the mid-1990s.</p>



<p>Analysts blamed a perfect storm of pandemic-related issues. &ldquo;The anticipation of a global recession, increased inflation, and higher interest rates have had a major impact on PC demand,&rdquo; said Mikako Kitagawa, the director analyst at Gartner. &ldquo;Since many consumers already have relatively new PCs that were purchased during the pandemic, a lack of affordability is superseding any motivation to buy, causing consumer PC demand to drop to its lowest level in years.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Still, IDC noted that 2022 shipments were well above pre-pandemic levels at 292.3 million units for the full year. Consumers bought up PCs at record rates in 2020 and 2021, but declined to upgrade those relatively new PCs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consecutive quarters of declines clearly paint a gloomy picture of the PC market, but this is really all about perception,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC&rsquo;s&nbsp;Worldwide Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers, in a statement. &ldquo;2021 was near historic levels for PC shipments, so any comparison is going to be distorted. There&rsquo;s no question when we look back at this time that the rise and fall of the PC market will be one for the record books, but plenty of opportunity still lies ahead. We firmly believe the market has the potential to recover in 2024 and we also see pockets of opportunity throughout the remainder of 2023.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Both firms named Lenovo, HP, and Dell as the top three worldwide PC vendors for the fourth quarter, though all suffered drops in the number of PCs sold by almost 30 percent. Lenovo ended the year with a 23 percent market share, followed by HP (19.6 percent) and Dell (16.1 percent), according to IDC. Apple (7.5 percent) and Asus (4.8 percent) rounded out the top five, IDC said, though Gartner agreed with the rankings as well. Gartner believes that the decline in shipments will persist during 2023.</p>

<p>The U.S. PC market recorded its sixth straight quarter of declining shipments. HP, Dell, Apple, Lenovo, and Asus ended the year as the top five PC vendors.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Even as vendors offered deep PC discounts during the holiday season in an attempt to lower inventory, consumers were not swayed to spare their money,&rdquo; Kitagawa said.</p>

## Microsoft 365 Basic is a gift for cheapskates

<p>Microsoft is celebrating 10 full years of Microsoft 365 by adding a new Microsoft 365 tier: Microsoft 365 Basic, which will cost just $1.99 per month or $19.99 per year when it launches on January 30.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s clear that Microsoft 365 Basic is designed to add new users, and add them to the ongoing treadmill that is Microsoft&rsquo;s subscription model. But the offerings aren&rsquo;t half bad, though there&rsquo;s a catch: Subscribers won&rsquo;t have access to the desktop versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, just the web and mobile versions of those apps. Otherwise, Microsoft is making 100GB of OneDrive cloud storage available, rather than the 1TB that accompanies the Microsoft 365 Personal ($6.99/mo) and Microsoft 365 Family ($9.99/mo) plans.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s pitch is that the new Basic plan will bring with it &ldquo;peace of mind,&rdquo; and the company points to the ability to back up one&rsquo;s photos as part of that. The Basic plan also offers access to Microsoft support for both Windows 11 and the Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365 apps), too. The free version of Microsoft 365, which includes the web/mobile versions of Microsoft 365 and just 5GB of cloud storage, does not.  </p>



<p>Microsoft 365 Basic will add both ransomware recovery and password-protected sharing links in OneDrive later in 2023, Microsoft said.</p>



<p>In addition to the new Microsoft 365 plan, Microsoft also plans to better communicate how OneDrive files are stored. &ldquo;With this update, you get a simplified overview of your storage usage across Microsoft 365, including OneDrive, Outlook, and more,&rdquo; Microsoft said.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft OneDrive quota" class="wp-image-1470470" height="255" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/OneDrive-quota.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>How your OneDrive storage quota will eventually look.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>The key appears to be that Microsoft will now break out various components of your storage quota. In an example, Microsoft showed how the storage quota could be separated into both general OneDrive storage, but also attachments sent along with Outlook email. That&rsquo;s another useful way to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394308/how-to-clean-up-your-outlook-inbox-and-manage-your-email.html">help you clean up your Outlook inbox</a> beyond the ways Microsoft already provides.</p>

<p>Computer memory is starting to get absolutely nuts, and nowhere is that more clear than in the latest hardware from Patriot&rsquo;s internal &ldquo;skunkworks&rdquo; labs. PCWorld contributor Keith May spoke with the RAM manufacturer at CES 2023, where the company was showing off its new Extreme 5 series of modules. Its top-of-the-line DDR5 hardware is shattering the limits of RAM speed and capability. </p>

<p>In a standard dual-channel setup with two 16GB sticks, with high-end off-the-shelf parts, the Extreme 5 memory can run stable at 8000MHz and 8000MT/s. Keith ran Cinebench R23 live, twice, just to demonstrate that the setup was operational and rock-solid. </p>



<p>Patriot is planning to have DDR5-8000 memory available in the next month or two (in both RGB and non-RGB flavors), and competitors have also announced similar designs.

## This bizarre VR microphone looks like a medieval torture device

<p>Look. I&rsquo;m not going to knock virtual reality as a concept. It provides some truly meaningful experiences to a lot of folks out there and there&rsquo;s no denying or dismissing that. <em>That said</em>, this strange VR microphone, which debuted at CES 2023, resembles a medieval torture device and it looks goofy as heck. While I appreciate the effort to improve communication in VR, I just can&rsquo;t get past the design. In the picture below, those people look <em>actually</em><strong> </strong><em>happy</em> to be wearing such a ridiculous thing. Huh?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Mutalk VR microphone" class="wp-image-1470242" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-9-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Shiftall</p></div>



<p>The device is called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.shiftall.net/products/mutalk&amp;xcust=2-1-1470130-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Mutalk</a> and it&rsquo;s designed to reduce ambient noise and sound leakage in VR environments. You wear it over your mouth like a dog muzzle or horse feed bag. It&rsquo;s kind of like noise cancelling headphones, but for your mouth instead of your ears. The microphone inside amplifies your voice in VR while the insulation material dampens it in the real world. In other words, this thing is designed to make private conversations in VR much easier. I suppose it&rsquo;s a good idea if you&rsquo;re in a business meeting or something, but I&rsquo;m still skeptical. </p>



<p>Shiftall, the company behind this interesting device, claims it will have a battery life of over ten hours. I can&rsquo;t imagine wearing the Mutalk for long periods of time, as it doesn&rsquo;t look super comfortable. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want other people to see me using this thing, either. It&rsquo;s a little too outside-the-box for me, personally. That said, if you&rsquo;re fine with wearing a muzzle to sound better in VRChat, pop off and enjoy it. </p>



<p>Mutalk is compatible with macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows. The device will become available this summer for about $200. </p>

## AMDâ€™s screaming new Ryzen X3D chips get February launch date

<p>AMD is here for PC gamers, and it isn&rsquo;t coming to lose. The company revealed a pair of new CPU variants at CES, updated versions of the gaming-friendly Ryzen 7 5800X3D based on the new Zen 4 architecture. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444835/amd-launches-fastest-gaming-processors-with-even-more-v-cache.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The new Ryzen 7 7800X3D, Ryzen 9 7900X3D, and Ryzen 9 7950X3D</a> will be launching on February 14th, just over a month from now. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.overclock3d.net/news/cpu_mainboard/amd_reveals_ryzen_7000_x3d_s_release_date_-_zen_4_with_a_gaming_boost/1&amp;xcust=2-1-1470136-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">courtesy of Overclock3D.net</a>, which spotted the new information on AMD.com. (The date, listed on each X3D entry, was yanked after reports like this surfaced.) Unfortunately, there wasn&rsquo;t news on prices. Since the variant processors include AMD&rsquo;s V-cache, the vertical die-stacking &ldquo;special sauce&rdquo; that gives the processors a gaming advantage, you can expect a premium over the vanilla <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html">Ryzen 9 7900X and Ryzen 9 7950X</a>. Those non-X3D CPUs have retail prices of $549 and $699, respectively, though street prices have seen significant discounts. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>According to promotional benchmarks from AMD, the top-of-the-line 7950X3D can beat Intel&rsquo;s best Core i9 processor in both gaming and (thanks to that generous 24-core architecture) general productivity and media production tasks. It is, in short, a beast, and the cheaper 8- and 12-core variants should show similar performance gains. </p>

## Hackers stole my personal info from Twitter. Twitter didnâ€™t tell me

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Well, 2023 is off to a rousing start. This morning I learned that my personal information was pilfered as part of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448100/twitter-leaked-data-on-over-200-million-users-heres-how-to-check-if-youre-affected.html">recent Twitter data breach</a> that leaked the email addresses, phone numbers, and other identifying data of over 200 million users. That sucks, but here&rsquo;s what <em>really </em>sucks: Twitter didn&rsquo;t tell me about it. So far, the Elon Musk-led social media company hasn&rsquo;t actively notified users (or at least <em>me</em>) of the worrying situation.</p>



<p>Instead, I woke up to an ID Alert notification from American Express, saying my personal info was found on the Dark Web on January 6. Great.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Brad Chacos Twitter breach Amex alert" class="wp-image-1470185" height="1033" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/amex-twitter-leak-alert-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="750" /><figcaption><p>The ID Monitoring Alert I received from American Express, telling me my data was leaked to the Dark Web as part of Twitter&rsquo;s 200 million user security breach. Twitter itself hasn&rsquo;t notified me of anything whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Passwords aren&rsquo;t known to be part of the breach, but a hack like this has significance&mdash;as American Express&rsquo;s warning spells out. The bandits could use the information to perform <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1469048/watch-out-for-phishing-attacks-after-the-latest-credit-breach.html">clever spear phishing or social engineering attacks</a> as well as relentlessly spamming you, fully confident that <em>you</em> <em>specifically</em> are the mark.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting and irresponsible that Twitter isn&rsquo;t directly notifying users about this, full stop. (Though <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1381758/dont-get-scammed-why-you-cant-trust-elon-musks-twitter-right-now.html">staying mum about potentially dangerous occurrences is Twitter&rsquo;s new normal</a> under Elon Musk.) Fortunately, even if you aren&rsquo;t subscribed to an ID or credit monitoring service&mdash;many credit cards offer them for free&mdash;you can still learn if your data was leaked. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448100/twitter-leaked-data-on-over-200-million-users-heres-how-to-check-if-youre-affected.html">how to check if you&rsquo;re one of the 200 million affected Twitter users</a>. Given the rampant nature of security breaches these days, also consider <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">using a password manager</a> if you aren&rsquo;t already. </p>



<p><em>And</em> given the nature of Twitter itself these days, I&rsquo;ll also echo my colleague Alaina Yee&rsquo;s advice:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&ldquo;Improving your Twitter security in particular might be a wise idea, given the company&rsquo;s upheaval since its change in ownership. Since Musk&rsquo;s takeover, much of the company was gutted, leaving a severely reduced workforce to grapple with site management&mdash;and no communications team to alert users to problems. These days the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1381758/dont-get-scammed-why-you-cant-trust-elon-musks-twitter-right-now.html">social media platform is far less trustworthy</a>&nbsp;and you&rsquo;re on your own if you stay.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>



<p>I&rsquo;ve already deleted the Twitter app off my phone and will only use the service via a browser from now on, where I can better control the information it&rsquo;s sucking in. Sick of it all and interested in alternatives?

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re revising an internal document at your office or looking over a creative project for a friend, sometimes <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/430947/how-to-track-changes-in-microsoft-word-without-going-insane.htmlhttps:/www.pcworld.com/article/430947/how-to-track-changes-in-microsoft-word-without-going-insane.html">marking your edits in Microsoft Word</a> is a little too definitive. Rather than switching back and forth between the document and an email, you can make notes directly in the document. This will help your recipient also keep track of which section you&rsquo;re referring to more easily. Luckily, making these notes is a simple process.</p>



<h2><strong>How to leave comments in a Word document on Windows</strong></h2>



<p>There are a few ways to leave comments in a Word document. If there&rsquo;s a specific place within the document you have in mind, click and hold the left mouse button over the section of words your comment pertains to. Once there is a grey bar over the selection, a bar will pop up with a <strong>New Comment</strong> option.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="How to add comments to a Word document" class="wp-image-1442815" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/new-comment-on-selected-words-microsoft-word-1200x800-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<p>After you click, a comment box will appear and you can type your note and click the button that looks like a <strong>send arrow</strong>. This will keep the words or sentence highlighted so the recipient will know where the comment goes. The comment will then stay in the sidebar for viewing, leaving the text of the document clean.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="How to add a comment in Microsoft Word" class="wp-image-1442612" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/comment-box-microsoft-word-1200x800-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<p>If you have general thoughts, but don&rsquo;t want to connect it to a specific part of the document, you can always use the <strong>Insert tab </strong>at the top and select <strong>Comment</strong> in the Comments section. This will pull up a comment box along the side of the page just as it does with a sentence selected.</p>



<h2><strong>More </strong>comment box options</h2>



<p>Once a comment is posted, you can edit it, delete it, resolve it, or link to it. If it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s and you have additional thoughts, you can reply. To edit, simply click the pencil button next to your name on the comment box.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="How to add a comment in Microsoft Word" class="wp-image-1442614" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/edit-comment-box-microsoft-word-1200x800-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<p>When you select the three dots at the top right of a comment box, there are a few options available. </p>



<p>To completely remove the comment, select <strong>Delete thread </strong>with the trash icon next to it and the box will disappear. To have the comment stay in place but mark that the note has been completed, select <strong>Resolve thread </strong>with the check mark icon. Finally, if you have a question on a specific comment and need to draw it out, instead of rewriting the whole thing in a correspondence, you can simply select <strong>Link to comment </strong>and it will take the user directly to the area you&rsquo;re referring to.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="How to add a comment in Microsoft Word" class="wp-image-1442616" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/link-resolve-delete-comment-box-microsoft-word-1200x800-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<p>You can also reply to a comment if you need further clarification, mark a completed date, or add further notes. Simply place your cursor in the reply box, type your message, and enter it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="How to add a comment in Microsoft Word" class="wp-image-1442617" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/reply-comment-box-microsoft-word-1200x800-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<h2><strong>How to leave comments in Word for the Web</strong></h2>



<p>Editing a comment works differently in Word for the Web. Instead of having its own icon within the comment box, you will need to select the three dots at the top and then click on <strong>Edit comment</strong> from the menu that drops down.</p>

<p>The annual Consumer Electronics Show has teased PC enthusiasts and gamers craving OLED monitors for years now, but has never left them satisfied. This was true even at last year&rsquo;s show. Yes, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html">the Alienware AW3423DW is excellent</a>, but I hoped its release would be the beginning of an OLED tidal wave. That never happened.</p>



<p>CES 2023 might be different. LG came to the show with a flashy 45-inch ultrawide and a more practical 27-inch 1440p, both of which are available for preorder right now. Samsung has fired back with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445207/samsungs-biggest-ultrawide-monitor-yet-will-bust-your-back-and-your-wallet.html">Odyssey OLED G9</a>, a flashy 49-inch super-ultrawide due for release in early 2023. They&rsquo;re impressive monitors, the OLED panels in them will go mainstream in displays from Asus, Acer, Alienware, Dough, and MSI, among others.</p>

<h2 id="oled-competition-is-coming">OLED competition is coming</h2>



<p>The unending dawn of OLED for PC monitors was due, at least in part, to a lack of options. OLED panels are produced by only a few companies, most notably LG and Samsung, and a mere handful of panel options were available to monitor manufacturers. The low production volume of OLED panels suitable for monitors kept prices high.</p>



<p>But at CES 2023, that changed. We have ourselves a race.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="lg-ultragear-27-oled" class="wp-image-1446873" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lg-ultragear-27-oled.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>LG&rsquo;s Ultragear 27 OLED monitor.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>LG and Samsung leaned into OLED for the PC market in 2020. You&rsquo;ve likely noticed the results if you&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">bought a PC laptop</a> in the past two years. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">Laptops with OLED displays</a> are much, much more common than they used to be, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1441384/this-699-asus-laptop-has-a-stunning-oled-display.html">now available in laptops below $1,000</a>.</p>



<p>The war between LG and Samsung will also improve the affordability of PC monitors. Both have their own OLED panel technology: LG offers a WRGB OLED panel, while Samsung offers QD-OLED. And both have incredible influence in the world of display technology and are familiar with working with a wide range of partners.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, LG won the battle at CES 2023. Samsung&rsquo;s QD-OLED, which is found in the Alienware AW3423DW and (of course) the new Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, looks spectacular. However, LG&rsquo;s new 27-inch 1440p 240Hz OLED panel is a superb fit for mainstream PC gamers, and LG is ramping up production to support <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446853/10-must-see-monitors-from-ces-2023-on-the-cusp-of-a-revolution.html">multiple third-party monitor makers</a>. It&rsquo;s likely this panel will dominate until Samsung can respond with a QD-OLED option of similar size.</p>

<p>CES 2023 was also a reminder that OLED technology faces broader competition. Several new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560224/oled-vs-mini-led-the-pc-displays-of-the-future-compared.html">Mini-LED monitors and laptop displays</a> arrived from multiple manufacturers including Acer, Asus, Razer, and Lenovo. Samsung, meanwhile, continues to invest in Micro-LED, a panel technology constructed from tiny LEDs, and showed its latest generation of NEO QLED 8K televisions at CES 2023.</p>



<p>Affordable Micro-LED televisions are years away, and monitors will be even more challenging due to their smaller size. Still, Mini-LED and Micro-LED represent a long-term threat to OLED. Both can deliver much higher levels of brightness, and do so without suffering the risk of burn-in. The evolution of alternative panel technologies gives LG and Samsung incentive to improve OLED&rsquo;s performance and cut costs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="subpixels-remain-an-issue">Subpixels remain an issue</h2>



<p>OLED has many perks, but it&rsquo;s not perfect. Most OLED panels found in computer monitors and laptops use a sub-pixel layout that differs from the RGB layout common to LCD displays. This can cause issues like color bleed or fringing around details and an overly pixelated look for small fonts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631720/pentile-displays-and-oled-clarity.html">What you need to know about OLED monitors, PenTile, and text clarity</a></p></blockquote>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="acer-predator-x45" class="wp-image-1446866" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-predator-x45.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Acer&rsquo;s curvaceous Predator X45 OLED looks absolutely outstanding in person.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>Let&rsquo;s set one thing straight: PC enthusiast hoping LG and Samsung have a cheap RGB-OLED panel up their sleeves should check their expectations. David Park, Senior Product Marketing Manager at LG, says the company&rsquo;s use of an alternative layout (in LG&rsquo;s case, WRGB) is purposeful.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the brightness. For the screen sizes that are 55, 65, and larger, we can add control architectures [&hellip;] we can use different picture algorithms to really push that brightness,&rdquo; says Park, explaining its current OLED panel technology for small displays is meant to maximize brightness for the display size. &ldquo;On the screen sizes that are 45, 27, we can&rsquo;t use the same technology, that brightness doesn&rsquo;t shine through. So, there&rsquo;s an advantage to using WRGB, where you get that white sub-pixel.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Samsung did not provide comment when asked if it might change the sub-pixel layout of future QD-OLED panels available for PC monitors. This likely means the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; &mdash; for the foreseeable future, at least.</p>

<p>Still, eagle-eyed PC enthusiasts have options. JOLED, a small company based in Tokyo, produces the excellent OLED panel found in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072564/asus-proart-oled-pa32dc-review.html">Asus ProArt Display OLED PA32DC</a>, which I reviewed last year, and the upcoming Asus ProArt Display OLED PA32DCM, a premium 4K OLED monitor revealed at CES 2023. JOLED&rsquo;s panels have excellent clarity, but the panels are produced in low volumes, which makes them expensive. They also don&rsquo;t offer the high refresh rate of LG and Samsung panels.</p>



<h2 id="finally-mainstream-availability-is-real">Finally, mainstream availability is real</h2>



<p>OLED&rsquo;s image quality, pixel response times, and low input latency make it an ideal technology for PC gaming and, for many people, general day-to-day-use. Yet high pricing and extremely limited availability have kept OLED monitors out of most homes.</p>



<p>2023 is the year that will finally change. Acer, Asus, Alienware, Corsair, and Dough are among the monitor makers with plans to release new OLED monitors. Some monitors based on new OLED panels, such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/916686/corsairs-new-oled-monitor-transforms-from-flat-to-curved.html">Corsair&rsquo;s Xeneon Flex</a>, are already available: others are currently up for pre-order.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDM_L" class="wp-image-1446869" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ROG-Swift-OLED-PG27AQDM_L.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>And this is just the start. &ldquo;[LG has] plans to introduce different screen sizes, different form factors,&rdquo; says Park. &ldquo;Throughout 2023, you&rsquo;ll hear more announcements from LG on different OLED monitors we&rsquo;re going to bring to the market.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Make no mistake: these monitors command a premium, and it&rsquo;s likely to be years before OLED comes close to the rock-bottom pricing of modern IPS LCD monitors. Still, many PC enthusiasts will happily pay a few hundred more for OLED&rsquo;s advantages&mdash;and in 2023, after years of waiting, that will finally be possible.</p>

## Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 vs. RTX 4080: Which 4K GPU should you buy?

<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s biggest competition often comes from&mdash;wait for it&mdash;Nvidia itself! It&rsquo;s only natural that the newest, most powerful two options from Team Green pique the interests of gamers across the realm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sure, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">GeForce RTX 4090</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">RTX 4080</a> share the same Ada Lovelace DNA, DLSS 3, and even the chunky cooler size. If we dig deeper, however, the two GPUs are more different than you might think. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll go over what you need to know if you&rsquo;re comparing these graphical powerhouses, including price, availability, and performance. Whichever route you take, we&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re going to be seeing some of the highest (and prettiest!) frames ever.</p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4090-vs-rtx-4080-price-and-availability">Nvidia RTX 4090 vs. RTX 4080: Price and availability</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 vs 4080" class="wp-image-1441788" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3K8A1216.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The big and beautiful RTX 4090.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>While the GeForce RTX 4090&rsquo;s MSRP of $1,599 is $400 more than the $1,199 RTX 4080 on paper, the real world tells us a different story. Here&rsquo;s the kicker: GPU availability is much improved in 2022, but it&rsquo;s still a serious issue for the RTX 4090.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RTX 4090 has been perpetually sold out since its launch, a familiar scenario to anyone who tried to buy a GPU in 2021. Thus, its street price is often higher on the secondary market. It&rsquo;s the most expensive GPU out now, but it also sold out the fastest&mdash;Nvidia has its cake and is eating it too!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RTX 4080, on the other hand, has been shipped in less volume, but it&rsquo;s more available, ironically. This is because it presents tremendously poor value for the performance you&rsquo;re getting, as PCWorld executive editor Brad Chacos pointed out in his <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">GeForce RTX 4080 summary</a>. (Nvidia asking for <em>$500</em> over the RTX 3080&rsquo;s MSRP is a bit much to stomach!)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, the RTX 4090 loses on availability specifically because it wins out on price-to-performance. Yes, even at $1,599. That&rsquo;s the weird 2022 GPU universe we&rsquo;ve landed in! To be fair, it does pack a serious punch that no other GPU can top currently, by a wide margin.</p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4090-vs-rtx-4080-performance">Nvidia RTX 4090 vs. RTX 4080: Performance</h2>



<p>The GeForce RTX 4090 is brutally, futuristically powerful. Ray tracing, content creation, whatever you throw at it&mdash;it chews up. No-compromises high refresh-rate 4K gaming allows it to put us truly on the next plane of performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a tough act to follow, and the RTX 4080 has an uphill battle. Starting with its 16GB of VRAM versus the 4090&rsquo;s 24GB of VRAM, the specs tell a lot of the story. In practice, most gamers will do just fine with 16GB of VRAM, especially since it&rsquo;s still the very fast GDDR6X variety like the RTX 4090 has. Content creators, though, could make better use of 24GB of VRAM, with one&rsquo;s use case being the determining factor when it comes to memory capacity.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4090 vs 4080" class="wp-image-1441789" height="1037" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/11-game-combined-fps.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>Combined FPS at 4K/Ultra for Nvidia GPUs.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>The synopsis presented in Brad Chacos&rsquo;s review of the RTX 4080 shows how big of an averaged-out lead the RTX 4090 has in 4K rasterized performance. Now all the &ldquo;Price to Performance&rdquo; talk starts to make sense in favor of the RTX 4090!</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4090 vs 4080" class="wp-image-1441792" height="911" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/codmw2-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some specific examples, starting with the newest <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>. The RTX 4090 has a significant lead at all resolutions, even 4K&mdash;by a whopping <strong>34fps</strong>! If you&rsquo;re gaming on a 4K 144Hz monitor, the RTX 4090 will come closest to taking advantage of it. Truth be told, however, 98fps on the RTX 4080 is still impressive and you&rsquo;re not likely to notice the difference in most practical situations.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4090 vs 4080" class="wp-image-1441794" height="935" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gears-tactics.jpg.webp" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>Looking at <em>Gears Tactics</em>, we find a potential problem with the RTX 4090: CPU bottlenecks. Past GPUs, even high-end ones, only used to encounter significant CPU bottlenecking issues at 1080p resolution, and rarely at 1440p. Here, we see the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 with similar 1440p frame rates due to the CPU&rsquo;s raw might becoming an issue. While 4K typically focuses heavily on GPU only, the RTX 4090 pushes so hard that the CPU can become a problem!&nbsp;In <em>Gears</em>, while the 4090 breezes past the 4080, we found it CPU-bound seven percent of the time even at lofty 4K resolution.</p>



<p>What&rsquo;s one to do? Well, if you&rsquo;re opting for the RTX 4090, you should be playing at 4K or at least very high-refresh 1440p at a minimum. If the latter, you&rsquo;ll need a top-of-the-line, ultra-fast gaming CPU like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html">Intel Core i9-13900K</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html">AMD Ryzen 9 7950X</a>, or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/701130/tested-the-ryzen-7-5800x3ds-astonishing-performance-shows-how-far-amds-ryzen-has-come.html">Ryzen 7 5800X3D</a> to circumvent potential performance bottlenecks. The GeForce RTX 4080 can still have these issues in some cases at 1440p, but they&rsquo;re much less noticeable.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4090 vs 4080" class="wp-image-1441796" height="930" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/rt-cyberpunk.jpg.webp" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>One of the biggest draws to RTX 40-series performance will be in Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS flavors, primarily <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-5">DLSS 3 and its killer Frame Generation feature</a>. While not every game supports this, the ones that do, such as <em>Flight Simulator 2020</em>, have great uplifts in performance. The RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 both have very powerful hardware built in to do this, but the RTX 4090 has a big spec advantage that gives it the outright lead when pushed hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why is DLSS important? Ray tracing is a big reason&mdash;which traditionally gives GPUs a performance penalty. With DLSS, you can have both awesome visuals and higher frames. (The stuff dreams are made of!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, we can go from 42.3 frames at 4K with ray tracing, to a whopping 83.9 with DLSS on the RTX 4090&mdash;and that&rsquo;s not even with DLSS 3 Frame Gen on, which sent performance skyrocketing to 138fps in our testing. The RTX 4080 brings its 29.1fps to 47.9fps. Sure, it&rsquo;s under 60fps, but it&rsquo;s still playable compared to under 30fps without DLSS. (It&rsquo;s worth noting our tests also set ray tracing settings to ultra, and reducing those to High can improve performance greatly.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that here the RTX 4090 is very far ahead with ray tracing over the RTX 4080, partly thanks to its hardware advantage. 83fps compared to 47fps is a big difference that you can certainly feel, putting the RTX 4090 truly in a class of its own.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1378383/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-content-creation-review.html">content creation both the RTX 4080</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1375901/tested-nvidias-geforce-rtx-4090-is-a-content-creation-monster.html">RTX 4090</a> prove to be very powerful. There may be a slightly different &ldquo;price-to-performance&rdquo; mindset if you&rsquo;re a content creator, since the RTX 4080 can be excellent even when compared to the RTX 4090 depending on your use case. In gaming, however, the RTX 4090 still takes the cake by a much wider margin&mdash;especially if you need its blazing-fast 24GB of GDDR6X memory for high-resolution video exports.</p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4090-vs-rtx-4080-power-and-other-things-to-know">Nvidia RTX 4090 vs. RTX 4080: Power and other things to know</h2>



<p>When you think of power-efficient GPUs, the last thing that pops into your mind is a four-slot RTX 4090, right? Well, what if I told you it has the same 450W TDP as the RTX 3090 Ti, but with oodles more performance? Likewise, the RTX 4080 has a TDP of 320W but is considerably more powerful than its predecessors. More performance, same power. If that&rsquo;s not efficiency, I don&rsquo;t know what is!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, we need to mention the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372988/heres-what-we-know-about-the-geforce-rtx-4090-12vhpwr-cables-melting.html">RTX 4090 12VHPWR adapter</a> and its well-publicized melt down issues. To sum it up, don&rsquo;t worry about it. There was a very low incidence rate, and the cause came down to mostly user error in connecting the adapter. (Make sure you push it all the way in!) There are other things to keep in mind, such as not bending the cable too much&mdash;which can be a problem on the very thick RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 in many PC cases. Since they often share similar coolers, they&rsquo;re about the same in terms of case requirements, too.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 vs 4080" class="wp-image-1441799" height="485" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-11-01-at-3.15.20-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The good thing about these oversized monsters is that both typically have excellent thermals due to the coolers, and quiet operation. Coil whine can still be an issue on both GPUS, however, if you&rsquo;re unlucky.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4090-vs-rtx-4080-the-verdict">Nvidia RTX 4090 vs RTX 4080: The verdict</h2>



<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s hard to say, &ldquo;Just get the $1,599 GPU!&rdquo; like it&rsquo;s a casual decision. We can talk about how and why we got here&mdash;but it&rsquo;s the reality of the situation.</p>



<p>If you have a big GPU budget that can cover a GeForce RTX 4090, and if you can find one, it&rsquo;s the obvious choice. The performance is simply unmatched. It will open up new gaming experiences for you that have never before been possible. 4K 144Hz? Ray tracing? We&rsquo;re here!</p>



<p>The RTX 4080, price aside, is not a bad GPU. It has great performance,&nbsp;thermals, and next-gen DLSS 3 with the second-best ray tracing performance. Not too shabby. It&rsquo;s also not particularly power hungry either. Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t put &ldquo;price aside&rdquo; permanently, and its wildly expensive for what you&rsquo;re getting as far as gaming goes. Content creators may find the RTX 4080 fits them well on their use case, however, so their &ldquo;math&rdquo; may be slightly more positive than for just gaming purposes. For gaming, the RTX 4090 is <em>it</em>, though!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RTX 4080&rsquo;s atrocious price makes the RTX 4090 truly seem like a much better option, with the least compromises. Hats off to you, GeForce RTX 4090, our winner!</p>

## Watch out for phishing attacks after the latest credit breach

<p>Experian, one of the biggest consumer credit reporting bureaus, likely put your full credit history into the hands of identity thieves last year. On Monday, news broke of a major flaw in the company&rsquo;s website, which allowed anyone with your name, address, birthdate, and Social Security number to bypass a security check and get to your report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First discovered by security researcher Jenya Kushnir, the exploit had an unknown duration and was only patched in late December 2022&mdash;seemingly after Brian Krebs of Krebs on Security, having been notified by Kushnir about the issue, brought it to Experian&rsquo;s attention. (You can read the full details in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/01/identity-thieves-bypassed-experian-security-to-view-credit-reports/&amp;xcust=2-2-1469048-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Kreb&rsquo;s post about the matter</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given how many data breaches have leaked all the information needed by identity thieves (including the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407339/equifax-hack-how-to-know-affected-data-breach.html">massive 2017 Equifax hack</a>), you can now assume your private financial info is out on the web. Accordingly, you&rsquo;ll want to be on guard against even more clever phishing scams in the future&mdash;the kind meant to disarm you with info you might assume only a legitimate source would have.</p>



<p>The good news is that your existing protective measures against phishing still apply here&mdash;you can look over <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394448/how-to-spot-an-online-scam-3-dead-giveaways.html">our guide to the important basics</a> if you need a refresher. But in the wake of this Experian leak, you should pay extra attention in a few specific situations:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Receiving calls or messages from so-called Experian representatives.</strong> You could receive a phone call, text message, or email from someone who says they represent Experian, claiming you must respond to a matter or verify personal information. It&rsquo;s likely a scam. Don&rsquo;t click on any links, and don&rsquo;t respond directly&mdash;follow up by reaching out to Experian via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.experian.com/contact/personal-services-contacts.html&amp;xcust=2-2-1469048-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the company&rsquo;s official contact methods</a>.</li><li><strong>Getting alerts about your credit accounts.</strong> Legitimate messages about your credit card, car loan, mortgage, or other debt often include info like the first or last few digits of your account. That information isn&rsquo;t private anymore. If you receive any warnings about your accounts, treat them with caution and don&rsquo;t click any links. Call or message your lender through the phone number or portal available on its website.</li><li><strong>Getting alerts about your bank accounts.</strong> The credit bureaus don&rsquo;t track checking and savings accounts, but many people use just one or two institutions for all their financial needs. An unexpected phone call, text message, or email could be a ploy to sus out info on your savings. Don&rsquo;t immediately trust anyone asking about these kinds of accounts, no matter how legitimate they sound.</li></ul>



<p>In the end, avoiding phishing attacks still boils down to the same defense: Have guards in place, like a trusted password manager and antivirus software on your PC to help with basic URL screening. Then, when unexpected communication arrives, always take a little time to think over the call or message. Nowadays, self-protection is the only line of defense between you and a massive headache&mdash;or worse.</p>
