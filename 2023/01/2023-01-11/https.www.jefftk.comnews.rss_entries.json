For example, they \n\n<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/against-malaria-foundation\">list\nthe Against Malaria Foundation</a> because \n\n<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\">GiveWell considers it a\ntop charity</a> and the \n\n<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/the-humane-league\">Humane\nLeague</a> because \n\n<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/#comprehensive-review\">Animal\nCharity Evaluators does</a>.  This \n\n<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pp2jmWHyDK9sfC4Rh/evaluating-the-evaluators-gwwc-s-research-direction\">approach</a>\nmakes sense: consolidating the reviews of multiple evaluators for\nthe GWWC membership and the broader EA community.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nOne place where this gets tricky is when their evaluators work in the\nsame area but have different funding bars.  This is most apparent in\nglobal health and development, where <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> and <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/\">Founders Pledge</a> overlap.\nGiveWell is willing to recommend funding opportunities if they are <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2021/11/22/we-aim-to-cost-effectively-direct-around-1-billion-annually-by-2025/#What_our_funding_bar_has_been\">5x-8x</a>\nbetter than <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">cash transfers to\nvery poor people</a> while Founders Pledge uses a bar of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ffmbLCzJctLac3rDu/strongminds-should-not-be-a-top-rated-charity-yet?commentId=asCgBvZbEEZvMqPxD\">at\nleast as good as cash transfers</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nReading GWWC's website it wasn't clear to me what they did.  For\nexample they badge the salt-iodization charity <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/iodine-global-network\">IGN</a>\nas \"top rated\" but not the cash transfer charity <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/givedirectly\">GiveDirectly</a>\nor the deworming charity <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/sci-foundation\">SCI</a>,\neven though Founders Pledge recommends all three.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf you look at the Founders Pledge recommendations <a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/stories/alleviate-poverty-report-summary\">for\nGiveDirectly</a> <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/deworming-children-report-summary\">and\nSCI</a> they start with a note that \"This is a Founders Pledge summary\nand interpretation of original research published by GiveWell.\"  So I\ninitially thought that what was happening was that they would mark the\ncharity as \"top rated\" if Founders Pledge recommends it based on their\nown evaluation, but not if Founders Pledge is just relying on\nGiveWell's evaluation and GiveWell doesn't recommend them.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis seemed bad: even if GiveWell, Founders Pledge, and GWWC all agreed\na charity was ~4x more effective than cash transfers, would GWWC\nrate it below one on which GiveWell had no opinion and Founders Pledge\nthought was only slightly more cost-effective than cash transfers?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI wrote to GWWC, and there's actually a good system behind these\nbadges.  They don't combine the ratings naively, but have their own\nintermediate threshold at ~3x better than cash transfers.  They're\nable to do this because while Founders Pledge doesn't publish\nefficacy estimates for charities they do have them internally, and\nthey coordinate with GWWC.  This explains why they don't mark\nGiveDirectly as \"top rated\": it's part of the baseline by which the\nother charities are measured.  And it also explains why IGN does get\nthe badge: Founders Pledge thinks it's at least 3x better than cash\ntransfers.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhat it doesn't explain, though, is why SCI isn't listed.  In November\n2021 GiveWell estimated (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kq6iHSQFr3eRz1p9KclHuJTQiaJYkpViOyneSd9KCJc/edit#gid=1346718756\">sheet</a>,\n<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2021/11/22/our-recommendations-for-giving-in-2021/#learn\">via</a>)\nthat donations to SCI were about 13x as effective as cash transfers.\n<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/08/17/changes-to-top-charity-criteria/\">The\nreason</a> GiveWell stopped recommending SCI as a top charity was not\nthat this estimate changed, but that GiveWell changed <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/criteria\">their\ncriteria</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\nWe have always supported deworming because we estimate it to be highly\ncost-effective&#8212;deworming programs are very inexpensive, and we think\nthere's a small chance they may lead to large income gains later in\nlife. But we're more uncertain about deworming than we are about our\ncurrent top charities, so deworming doesn't fulfill the second\ncriterion on our list&#8212;a high likelihood of substantial\nimpact. However, we expect to continue supporting deworming through\ngrants from our All Grants Fund, as there continue to be funding\nopportunities in deworming that exceed our cost-effectiveness\nthreshold, and we encourage donors who have supported individual\ndeworming programs in the past to keep doing so\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIn their response to my questions GWWC pointed me to their note on\ntheir <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/sci-foundation\">page\nfor SCI</a> where they said \"We intend to reevaluate the status of all\nof the charities listed on our platform that are working on deworming\nprogrammes after one of our trusted evaluators, Founders Pledge,\npublishes its review of deworming's cost-effectiveness.\"  They also\ntold me that until Founders Pledge finishes their re-evaluation of\ndeworming they don't want to list them as \"top rated\".  Unless they\nhave some reason to think that GiveWell's estimate of SCI's cost\neffectiveness has fallen by a factor of four in the last year,\nhowever, I don't think the decision to withhold this designation makes\nsense.  GiveWell dropping them as a top charity was a decision about\nhow to handle risk and uncertainty, and GWWC accepts Founders Pledge\nrecommendations which both (a) include some reviews much older than\n2021 and (b) are more accepting of risk than GiveWell was even before\nthe <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/08/17/changes-to-top-charity-criteria/\">August\n2022 changes</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAside from the questions about how SCI and other deworming charities\nshould be badged, however, my main takeaway here is that I'd like to\nsee more public details from GWWC about this process in their <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/inclusion-criteria\">inclusion\ncriteria</a>.  Specifically, I'd like to see them describe their ~3x\ncash threshold and use of Founders Pledge internal estimates.  I'd\nalso like to see Founders Pledge make their estimates public, or at\nleast publish which of their recommendations meet the 3x bar.  The\nidea driving this is that, as I wrote earlier this week, I think the\n\"recommending specific charities\" portion of GWWC's work <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/gwwc-should-require-public-charity-evaluations\">should depend\nonly on public information</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n<i>Disclosure: <a href=\"https://juliawise.net/\">my wife</a> used to be\nPresident of GWWC, but I haven't run this post by her and I don't know\nwhat she thinks here.
