<p>I am yet again reminded that every day we fall further from the grace of God. </p><p>The Trump administration banned transgender individuals with gender dysphoria from serving <a href="https://partner-mco-archive.s3.amazonaws.com/client_files/1521897476.pdf" target="_blank">after</a> a panel of experts concluded they could hinder readiness within the military and provoke division. The Biden administration's more "inclusive" approach involves forcing women to shower with naked men. Yay for unity! </p><p>On the bright side, the army is putting out very helpful guidance for when its female soldiers are confronted with a penis in their previously, and preferably, penis-free space. </p><p>Regarding showers, the training reads, "Soldiers must accept living conditions that are often austere, primitive, and characterized by little or no privacy." Female soldiers may soon find themselves showering next to "a female who has male genitalia." Commanders can install shower curtains and hooks, though it'll be on their own dime-- the army won't pay for such modern luxuries. </p><p>It's important to note that the military DOES <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/06/28/army-provide-gender-transition-care-surgeries-transgender-soldiers.html" target="_blank">pay</a> for gender transition surgery and cross-hormone therapy. Gender transition surgeries can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, not to mention the pricey aftercare. But those pesky shower hooks? Now you're just being greedy. </p><p>The guidance also instructs soldiers how to react to a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/democrats-think-men-get-pregnant" target="_blank">male who becomes pregnant</a>, because that's something we're all supposed to pretend can happen in this bizarre reality. The guidance reads, "Understand that Soldiers who have transitioned gender may remain susceptible to medical conditions associated with their birth gender." </p><p>"Medical conditions" like...male pregnancy. If any actual male believes themselves to be pregnant, they should probably seek medical attention immediately. And not for the "baby." </p><p><p>

His daughter Stephanie McMahon became CEO. His son-in-law Paul Levesque took over creative. The quality of the product changed and was both watchable and praised by wrestling fans when it had been the drizzling shits for years when Vince was in charge. Vince said, "bump that." He forced his way back into the company. His daughter quit. He became Chairman again.

Saudi Arabia is in the running and outlets that reported it were quoting their sources accurately. However, it could very well be the case their sources leaked what they heard as a trial balloon to see how fans would react. Or, they leaked the info because they <em>KNEW</em> how fans would react and wanted to squash the deal with bad press before it went too far. </p><p>And oy, was there a negative reaction. You know, what with the human rights violations in Saudi Arabia thing, the say goodbye to women's wrestling thing, the multiple wrestlers leaving the company over conscientious objections thing, and the fact there are current WWE wrestlers who already stay home from the Saudi Arabian tours out of fear they will get murdered for their religious beliefs.<br /></p><p>I would be a combination of shocked and disgusted if the deal went through. But over the last thirty-eight years or so I've learned that anything can happen in the WWE.</p><p><p>

These gaseous byproducts of nature even got their own <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/herere-8-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-idiotic-green-new-deal" target="_blank">feature</a> in Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's Green New Deal: </p><p><em>"We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of </em><strong>farting</strong><em> cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero."</em></p><p>Indeed, the invisible excrement of livestock has been plaguing <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-racial-justice-cimate-change" target="_blank">AOC's</a> tiny, tiny brain for years now. <br /></p><p>But now, a joyous day: a potential solution that could use cow doo-doo for good rather than evil. Meet the New Holland T7, the world's first tractor that runs entirely on cow poop. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201c\ud83d\udd34 The world\u2019s first manure-powered tractor has been unveiled by a British firm in a move that could prompt a green revolution on farms https://t.co/ZJDaxpisAm\u201d</div> — The Telegraph (@The Telegraph)

<p>Developed by the Cornish firm Bennaman, the tractor is powered by liquid biomethane fuel created from manure. The manure is harvested from an entire herd of cows and put into biomethane storage units, compressed, and turned into fuel. A cryogenic fuel tank attached to the tractor keeps the fuel at the perfect poop-preserving temperature of -162C. </p><p>According to the creators, a 150-cow-farm would balance the emissions of 140 households per year. So with approximately 128 million households in the US, we only need...many, many cows. Like the equivalent of a few small nations, but cows. The farm would probably become a tourist attraction, just due to the sheer volume of cows. </p><p>Now, I know what you're thinking: this sounds great and all, but wouldn't it be <em>really </em>great if we could not only fill our tractors with cow poo, but even our <em>cars? </em>One step ahead of you. The company is hoping to one day use manure to charge electric vehicles. Yay, progressivism! </p><p><p>

In 2019, she suggested that Israeli allies in America are "all about the Benjamins, baby." She later apologized and said she was "learning."</p><p>The Democrats are quite up in arms over McCarthy's decision to strip these, er, fine representatives of their committee assignments.

Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments for being a cOnSpIrAcY theorist. </p><p>One would think actual national security threats or hatred of Jewish people would be universally condemned as worse than having some kooky beliefs about politics. But alas, it is 2023. Therefore, everything is upside-down and backward. </p><p><p>

<p>Some fascinating facts about Mexican president Andres Manuel López Obrador. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mexican-president-calls-for-strict-gun-control-in-america" target="_blank">He demanded stricter gun control in America</a>. At the start of Joe Biden's border crisis, Obrador <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/illegal-immigration-biden-mexico" target="_blank">referred to Biden as the "migrant president"</a> and worried he was "stoking illegal immigration" that would have been curbed with a border wall.

## Joy Reid gets wrecked by Rep. Byron Donalds on her own show and it's fun to watch

Byron Donalds. We at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stimulus-pelosi-byron-donalds" target="_blank">have been fans since the beginning</a>. When the NeverKevins needed someone who wasn't Kevin McCarthy to nominate for Speaker of the House, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/byron-donalds-reporter-cori" target="_blank">they went with the 6'2, 275 lbs Florida Congressman</a>.</p><p>Joe Reid invited Donalds on her MSNBC show. <a href="https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/kevin-tober/2023/01/10/fireworks-byron-donalds-schools-joy-reid-social-security-crt" target="_blank">After getting wrecked this badly</a>, I don't see her inviting him back.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p>Joy tried the "Republicans want to destroy social security" schtick on him.</p><blockquote>Joy, I'm a finance professional. I do more than just Congress. I worked in the financial community. I'm telling you. Social Security will go insolvent.</blockquote><p>She attempted to attack Florida's common sense voter-integrity reform to the Florida Congressman.</p><blockquote>[Florida has] the best election laws in the country. Florida laws are the best election laws in the country. Go ask Arizona, go ask California, go ask New York. We do it the best.</blockquote><p>Then came claims Republicans don't want to talk about "racial history."</p><blockquote>The issue with Critical Race Theory if you distill it down to K-12 education is you do not have the ability to have the detailed conversation of Critical Race Theory at the graduate level. And so here's my question. If it seeps down into K-12 education, is it stuff students shouldn't be prepared to be dealing with? Shouldn’t students just be learning about reading writing and arithmetic?</blockquote><p>Reid got the last word in claiming that CRT <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/byron-donalds-math-textbook" target="_blank">isn't taught in K-12</a>. Which is at best semantics, and ignores <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/teachers-union-president-crt" target="_blank">the teacher's unions fighting to teach CRT in K-12</a>.</p><p>There was another part of Rep. Donalds' appearance that his colleague Rep. Eric Swalwell noted.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BREAKING</a> Rep. <a href="https://twitter.com/ByronDonalds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ByronDonalds</a> admits on <a href="https://twitter.com/thereidout?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thereidout</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpeakerMcCarthy</a> is kicking me, <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RepAdamSchiff</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/Ilhan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Ilhan</a> off our committees purely out of vengeance.<br />— Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSwalwell/status/1612968347397947394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Two things. One, I'm okay with vengeance. Two, you put your dick in a spy.</p><p>It's not enough for conservative officials to have the right opinions on issues and policies. You also need to ability to go on non-conservative outlets to sell those issues. And in the case of legacy media content creators such as MSNBC, where you know you'll be met with animosity and disdain, you need the skill to counter all their arguments and not fall into leftist traps.</p><p>Byron Donalds is well-versed in doing all of that. He needs to be out there more.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Chris Pratt throws back to being 'given 3 minutes to impart wisdom' to MTV. He spent it talking about God.

My first official-ish title was LwC Senior @PrattPrattPratt Correspondent. It's when we first noticed Chris Pratt. He went from "whatshisface on <em>Parks and Rec</em>" to being a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-meat-eats-vegan" target="_blank">dude that was based AF</a>. Hints and clues were dropped every so often. But it was an award show where things really blew up. For reasons known only to His Royal Prattness,  the actor threw it back to this moment on Instagram yesterday.</p><p>The year was 2018. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga ruled the airwaves. A young Joe Biden made us laugh at the prospect he would ever be elected president. And Chris Pratt received the "Generation Award" at MTV's Movie and Television awards. Pratt has tripled down on a lot of these ideas since then. But this was our first taste of our dude NOT being your typical A-list celebrity.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="instagram-media"><div style="padding: 16px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CnQaw2ipx5n/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div> <div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"> <div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CnQaw2ipx5n/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Chris Pratt (@prattprattpratt)</a><br /></div></blockquote> </div><p>Some highlights, other than not being a turd.

</p><p>We know what happened from here. Leftists saw a guy with a platform who held different opinions than them, and decided he must be canceled and destroyed. There was a pattern where Pratt would announce a movie, say something nice about his wife, or exist, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-defends-chris-pratt" target="_blank">and leftists would go bananas</a>. Every movie trailer led to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-james-gunn-thor" target="_blank">a version of "Cancel Chris Pratt"</a> that would trend on Twitter.</p><p>Then Elon Musk fired the commies who decided what trends on Twitter, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-cancelled-twitter" target="_blank">and there were no more "Chris Pratt is Over" parties</a>. Go figure.</p><p>It all started with one three-minute acceptance speech and nine rules. That he put in a hamburger so you didn't know you were eating medicine.</p><p><span></span><p>

## Watch: Eddie Murphy's 'blueprint for success' had the audience howling (but Will Smith will hate it)

It would be disappointing if <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-cosby-bill-clinton-bbc" target="_blank">Bill Cosby</a> made his return to the stage before Eddie Murphy did. While Eddie hasn't announced a comedy special yet, we get flashes of his brilliance whenever he's given a special award.

<p>At last year's Academy Awards, Chris Rock made a joke about a movie that Will Smith found funny. The rub is that Will Smith's wife didn't find it funny, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/will-smith-chris-rock-oscars" target="_self">so Smith assaulted Rock on stage</a>. Smith's wife <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jada-pinkett-smith-laughing" target="_self">found THAT funny</a>, even though she is a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jada-pinkett-smith-responds" target="_self">"strong woman" who "didn't" want her husband</a> to do that. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adam-sandler-chris-rock-oscars" target="_self">The Grown-Ups were activated</a>. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-attacked-hollywood-bowl" target="_self">Jokes were made</a>. Four months later, Will Smith posted a lame-ass apology. Ten months later, we're still making jokes about it!</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="58885" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32766574&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>While there are no clues about a return to stand-up, Eddie is at the very least making a return to adult comedy. He is currently starring in <em>You People</em> with Jonah Hill. It's about a Jewish guy (not played by Eddie) who gets engaged to a black girl and finds out her family are followers of Louis Farrakhan. The premise sounds hilarious. And the fact Netflix hasn't canceled it yet in this post-Ye America is saying something.</p><p>Not that it's better than a return to the stage for Murphy. I'm not saying he needs the leather suits again. But in just the little glimpses we've seen, his timing and delivery are still on point. America needs a full hour special.</p><p><p>
