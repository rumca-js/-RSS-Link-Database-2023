## Apple is reportedly working on a touchscreen MacBook Pro

<p>Apple is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/apple-working-on-adding-touch-screens-to-macs-in-major-turnabout?sref=10lNAhZ9">reportedly</a> working on touchscreen MacBooks. Although the plans aren’t finalized, <em>Bloomberg</em>’s sources say that touch-friendly Apple laptops could arrive in 2025.</p><p>For a company that has made a point of saying that touch is better on a product like the iPad, a touchscreen MacBook would be a big change — but don't expect a wild departure from traditional Apple laptop design. The alleged touchscreen MacBook Pro would “likely” still run macOS and include a standard trackpad and keyboard. But, similar to Windows laptops and 2-in-1s, it would incorporate display taps and gestures. The report says Apple may expand the touch input to include other Mac models over time, but it isn’t currently planning on combining macOS and iPadOS. (One can surmise that fear of cannibalizing iPad sales has been a factor in holding out this long.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, the report reiterates that Apple is shifting its Mac displays to OLED as part of a broader MacBook Pro overhaul. Current Macs have LCDs, while iPhones (except for the iPhone SE) and Apple Watches use OLED displays.</p><figure><img alt="Touch Bar and keyboard on the 2016 MacBook Pro" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/195a9f40-9203-11ed-be39-72cf7a0ddd0e" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Apple launched the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-14-macbook-pro-review-2016.html">Touch Bar</a> in 2016 as a half measure towards full touchscreen capabilities on MacBooks. The strip above the keyboard included system and in-app shortcuts, spelling suggestions and other touch-friendly inputs. But it was never embraced by developers or Apple’s most loyal customers, and it was removed from Apple’s 2021 MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">redesign</a>.</p><p>Although much has been made of Steve Jobs’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-11-03-hp-responds-to-jobs-about-touchscreen-pcs.html">insistence</a> that touchscreens don’t belong on Macs, this wouldn’t be the first time the company has evolved in ways that go against “the gospel of Steve.” For example, he mocked big iPhones, small tablets and iPad styluses; today, Apple will happily sell you an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-review-dynamic-island-useful-always-on-display-battery-life-camera-test-sample-pictures-130020449.html">iPhone 14 Pro Max</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html">iPad mini</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-10-apple-ipad-pro-pencil-designer-reaction.html">Apple Pencil</a>. Although Jobs’s vision is very much instilled in the company’s DNA, the computing world has changed slightly since 2011.</p>

## PC shipments saw their largest decline ever last quarter

<p>It's no secret that the conditions were ripe for a steep drop in PC demand this holiday, but now it's clear just how bad that plunge really was. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-01-11-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-declined-28-percent-in-fourth-quarter-of-2022-and-16-percent-for-the-year">Gartner</a> and <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50031623">IDC</a> estimate PC shipments fell by more than 28 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022. That's the steepest quarterly decline Gartner has ever recorded — no mean feat when it began tracking the computer market in the 1990s. Both analyst groups also saw yearly shipments fall by more than 16 percent in 2022 compared to the year earlier.</p><p>Some manufacturers suffered more of a blow than others. The top three brands, Lenovo, HP and Dell, saw their shipments tumble between 29 percent and 37 percent in late 2022 compared to a year earlier. Acer took a staggering 41 percent hit, according to Gartner. Fourth-place Apple took a relatively light blow, although that still meant its shipments dropped by as much as 10 percent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Gartner and IDC share the same explanation. PC sales <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pc-market-2021-surge-175436545.html">soared in 2021</a> as people continued to work from home during the pandemic, but that interest tanked as people gradually returned to the office. Moreover, a worsening global economy left people with less money to spend on upgrades. Would-be customers either had a recent PC or had trouble affording a new one, to put it simply.</p><p>IDC is quick to put the seeming freefall into context. While the quarterly and yearly drops were sharp, shipments in 2022 were still &quot;well above&quot; pre-pandemic figures, according to researchers. While demand still looks grim, the market was still stronger than before.</p><p>Just don't expect the PC's heyday to return for a while. Neither analyst group expects the market to recover in earnest until 2024, and IDC only sees &quot;pockets of opportunity&quot; in 2023. Whether they like it or not, PC makers may have to brace themselves and hope that a combination of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-yoga-book-9-i-hands-on-ces-2023-a-huge-leap-for-dual-screen-laptops-160045296.html">new designs</a> and price cuts will sustain interest for the next year.</p>

## The Guardian says ransomware attack compromised staff's personal data

<p><em>The Guardian</em> has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jan/11/guardian-confirms-it-was-hit-by-ransomware-attack">confirmed</a> that it was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-guardian-suspected-ransomware-attack-191542719.html">victim of a ransomware attack</a>, and that the damage is more serious than first thought. In an update to staff, Guardian group chief Anna Bateson and newspaper editor-in-chief Katharine Viner said the December attack was &quot;highly sophisticated&quot; and accessed the personal data of UK employees. There was no evidence of the data being exposed online, or that the intruders had breached data for readers or non-UK editions.</p><p>Bateson and Viner understood that this was a &quot;criminal&quot; ransomware campaign, and that the perpetrators hadn't targeted <em>The Guardian</em> as a media outlet. The paper has alerted both police as well as the UK's Information Commissioner's Office. The leaders didn't identify the suspected culprits.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The fallout from the cyberattack has worsened. While <em>The Guardian</em> now expects some vital systems to return within two weeks, workers now won't return to the office until early February. That will give the IT team more time to restore infrastructure, the outlet said. Staff have largely been working from home since the attack was spotted on December 20th, but were originally told only to stay away from the office for the remainder of that week.</p><p>The company has continued to run its online and print publications in the weeks since. Even so, the confirmation still makes this one of the more serious online security incidents for the press in recent memory. <em>Fast Company</em> was knocked offline <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fast-company-back-after-obscene-apple-news-alerts-hack-085808021.html">for eight days</a> early last fall, while <em>The New York Post</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-post-hacked-152226630.html">fell prey to a rogue employee</a> weeks later. <em>The Guardian</em> is still dealing with the consequences of the ransomware over three weeks later, and won't return to normality for a while yet.</p>

## Twitter could launch in-app ‘coins’ to help creators make money

<p>It seems Elon Musk’s Twitter is working on a new scheme to make money from the platform. The service appears to be experimenting with an in-app currency called “coins” meant to help creators earn money from the platform, according to screenshots shared by two app researchers.</p><p>The feature has been spotted in recent days by <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1612705022109978625">Jane Manchun Wong</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1612720984997646337">Nima Owji</a>, app researchers who often publish images of unreleased features. According to their posts, coins appear to be an extension of Twitter’s existing tipping feature. “Coins allow you to support creators who Tweet great content,” reads a screenshot shared by Wong and Owji. An image shared by Owji back<a href="https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1599144378962153473"><ins> in December</ins></a> showed a new “Coins” tab in the same section where users can keep track of their tips.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For now, it’s unclear exactly what Twitter’s plans are for coins or when the feature could launch. The company, which no longer employs communications staff, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the screenshots suggest Twitter is at least considering featuring coins prominently in its app as both Wong and Owji spotted it in the main sidebar.</p><div id="c67bbbe122064fc493817e9708ab31f6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Here’s the list of Twitter Awards: <a href="https://t.co/PpgHebBWD6">https://t.co/PpgHebBWD6</a><a href="https://t.co/BePDVAkzhy">pic.twitter.com/BePDVAkzhy</a></p>— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1610978948044951553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>But coins may not be just for tipping. Wong also spotted an “Awards” feature, which allows people to use coins to buy in-app gifts for others. According to the image shared by Wong, users would be able to buy gifts for as little as one coin (called “Mind Blown”) or as much as 5000 (called “Gold”). It’s not clear how much coins will cost, though Twitter would presumably get a cut of revenue generated from coin purchases.</p><p>So far, Elon Musk doesn’t seem to have publicly weighed in on coins or awards, but he has spoken broadly about wanting more ways for creators to be rewarded. He’s <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587505731611262976"><ins>said</ins></a> that Twitter Blue revenue would potentially “give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators” <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1589010272341340160"><ins>and that</ins></a> “creator monetization for all forms of content” is also in the works.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that despite the “coins’ moniker, the feature doesn’t seem to have any cryptocurrency tie-ins, at least for now. “Twitter Coin is still under development and we don't even have any evidence that it's something related to crypto,” Owji <a href="https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1613115672233496577"><ins>noted</ins></a>. “Don’t let the scammers fool you.”</p>

## Ubisoft cancels three games and delays 'Skull and Bones' yet again

<p>Things aren't exactly going smoothly over at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ubisoft/"><ins>Ubisoft</ins></a>. The publisher has canceled another three games, following the four titles <a href="https://www.engadget.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-game-release-date-delay-175756156.html"><ins>it killed last summer</ins></a>. Not only that, the company has announced yet another delay for <em>Skull and Bones </em>— a game we first tried <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-16-skull-and-bones-impressions-e3-2017.html"><ins>all the way back at E3 2017</ins></a>. The pirate sim was supposed to finally emerge <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-skull-and-bones-delay-will-this-game-ever-come-out-180840974.html">on March 9th</a>, but Ubisoft has delayed it until the early part of its 2023-24 fiscal year, which starts in April. This is the sixth publicly announced delay of <em>Skull and Bones.</em></p><p>&quot;Players will be able to discover the beauty of <em>Skull and Bones</em> in the upcoming beta phase. The additional time has already paid off and brought impressive improvements to its quality, which has been confirmed by recent playtests,&quot; Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.akamaized.net/8aefmxkxpxwl/3nCTlhd4Dke8pe308etZ6e/b11d0bfe9c5094f0eecd44541c6ba0b8/Ubisoft_update_January_23_English_Final.pdf"><ins>said in a financial statement</ins></a>. &quot;We believe players will be positively surprised by its evolution. We have decided to postpone its release in order to have more time to showcase a much more polished and balanced experience and to build awareness.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, the company lowered its financial projections target for the October-December quarter from around €830 million ($891 million) to approximately €725 million ($779 million). <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-preview-interview-162012953.html"><em><ins>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/just-dance-2023-online-multiplayer-release-date-202044681.html"><em><ins>Just Dance 2023</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>didn't perform as well as the company expected. &quot;We are facing contrasted market dynamics as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and everlasting live games, in the context of worsening economic conditions affecting consumer spending,&quot; CEO Yves Guillemot said.</p><p>Ubisoft expects its net bookings to fall by 10 percent for the year. Previously, the company expected that those revenues would increase by 10 percent. All told, Ubisoft has reduced its estimated operating income for this year by <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/11/ubisoft-cancels-update">around $1 billion</a>.</p><p>Going forward, Ubisoft is tightening its belt and will focus on fewer games. The company is depreciating €500 million ($538 million) in research and development on the canceled games, as well as its upcoming premium and free-to-play titles. It's also aiming to reduce costs by over €200 million ($215 million) in the next two years through &quot;targeted restructuring, divesting some non-core assets and usual natural attrition.&quot; However, it plans to keep hiring &quot;highly talented people&quot; for its major projects.</p><p>Aside from <em>Skull and Bones</em>, perhaps the biggest title Ubisoft currently has on the docket for this year is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassin-creed-mirage-2023-release-date-200751800.html"><em><ins>Assassin's Creed Mirage</ins></em></a>. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-game-release-date-delay-175756156.html"><em><ins>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is slated to arrive by the end of March 2024 as well. Other unannounced premium games are in the pipeline for the next fiscal year, including &quot;a large one.&quot; Free-to-play titles for some of Ubisoft's biggest brands are in the works too. Given its current state of affairs, the company will need most, if not all of those, to be hits.&nbsp;</p>

## Universal Audio launches two new premium microphones

<p>Universal Audio is known for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-audio-uafx-guitar-amp-emulators-190011762.html">leading software emulation</a> that mimics the quality of more expensive gear. After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-audio-microphones-200032709.html">entering the modeling microphone space</a> last year with the L22, the company is back with a pair of mics that, while fairly pricey, could appeal to serious bedroom producers.</p><p>The Sphere DLX is the higher-end model at $1,499. It emulates 38 classic ribbon, condenser, and dynamic studio mics — including models from Neumann, Telefunken, AKG, Sony and others. (That’s up from the 34 models that last year’s LP22 emulated.) UA says the DLX can capture acoustic guitars and drum overheads in stereo with a single mic. In addition, it can “easily tame room coloration for cleaner, more professional recordings using IsoSphere presets tailored for bedroom studios and popular isolation filters.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Sphere LX is a smaller (and slightly cheaper) model supporting 20 ribbon, condenser and dynamic mic models. The $999 mic has dual gold-sputtered diaphragms and what UA describes as the lowest noise of any mic in its class.</p><figure><img alt="A singer in a studio with her eyes closed singing into the UA Sphere LX microphone" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/737c1020-91d7-11ed-ad6c-a0a7d87fbcb7" style="height: 844; width: 1500;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Universal Audio</div></figure><p>UA says both models let you “change the mic type, polar pattern and other characteristics, even after tracking with any interface, in any DAW.” Additionally, they have Apollo interface presets designed to help users attain professional-sounding audio quickly with near-zero latency. Each device ships with a carrying case, mic stand mount and cable (25 feet for the Sphere DLX and 10 feet for the LX). The DLX also includes a shock mount.</p><p>Both mics are now shipping worldwide. Although the new models will likely be too expensive for many burgeoning creators, the mics are still relatively affordable compared to the premium gear they emulate (some could cost upwards of $5,000). At the very least, they provide more options for experienced podcasters, streamers and musicians who want to upgrade their sound quality.</p>

## Biden calls for bipartisan legislation to keep Big Tech in check

<p>In an op-ed for <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3VuaXRlLWFnYWluc3QtYmlnLXRlY2gtYWJ1c2VzLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1wcml2YWN5LWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWFudGl0cnVzdC1jaGlsZHJlbi1hbGdvcml0aG0tMTE2NzM0Mzk0MTEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjhmNTRlNWVlLTM0ZDYtNGM3Yy04NTc0LWZjYzE4ODcwZmM0NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfg1Cs5vcbMZtYMZMFijngvHABXKlkLq8TJ-1TWJMobI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Funite-against-big-tech-abuses-social-media-privacy-competition-antitrust-children-algorithm-11673439411"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, President Joe Biden has called on Democrats and Republicans who are sitting in Congress to set aside their differences and work on strong bipartisan legislation to keep major technology companies in check — without calling any businesses out by name. While he said he was proud of the success of the American tech industry, Biden expressed concern about how some actors "collect, share and exploit our most personal data, deepen extremism and polarization in our country, tilt our economy’s playing field, violate the civil rights of women and minorities and even put our children at risk."</p><p>Biden has pinpointed three areas that he says require reform, starting with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/privacy/">privacy</a>. He argued that "serious federal protections" are needed in this area, including "clear limits on how companies can collect, use and share highly personal data," such as location, browsing history and communications, as well as health, biometric and genetic data. Biden says companies shouldn't be collecting much of that data at all.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>"These protections should be even stronger for young people, who are especially vulnerable online," Biden wrote. "We should limit targeted advertising and ban it altogether for children." Just yesterday, Meta said Facebook and Instagram could still target teens with ads based on their age and location, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-ad-targeting-limits-181607863.html">but not their gender</a>.</p><p>In discussing the need for "Big Tech companies to take responsibility for the content they spread and the algorithms they use," the president reiterated his belief that lawmakers should reform Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from liability for what their users do. In the leadup to the 2020 election, Biden claimed that he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-s230-repeal.html">would see Section 230 "revoked, immediately"</a> if he became president. While that hasn't happened yet, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/health-misinformation-act-2021-204010072.html">senators</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-bill-justice-against-malicious-algorithms-act-162915185.html">members of Congress</a> have introduced several bills over the last few years with the aim of curtailing Section 230.</p><p>Meanwhile, Biden demanded much more transparency from major tech companies about the algorithms they use "to stop them from discriminating, keeping opportunities away from equally qualified women and minorities, or pushing content to children that threatens their mental health and safety." Algorithmic bias has been a hot-button issue in some circles for many years. Some, for instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-says-its-algorithms-amplify-the-political-right-but-it-doesnt-know-why-205859230.html">incorrectly believed</a> that Twitter's algorithms were biased against conservative perspectives. Elected officials have made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wyden-algorithmic-accountability-act-2022-205854772.html">several attempts</a> to make tech companies accountable for algorithmic bias too.</p><p>Senators have also expressed concern that platforms haven't done enough to protect children. A bipartisan bill <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-kids-online-safety-act-bill-141708555.html">submitted last February</a> sought to give children more privacy and safety protections on social media while requiring platforms to minimize their exposure to content concerning things like self-harm, eating disorders, sexual exploitation and alcohol.</p><p>The third area Biden wants to focus on is bolstering competition in the tech industry. "When tech platforms get big enough, many find ways to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-eu-european-commission-antitrust-settlement-third-party-sellers-160026620.html">promote their own products while excluding or disadvantaging competitors</a> — or charge competitors a fortune to sell on their platform," he wrote. "My vision for our economy is one in which everyone — small and midsized businesses, mom-and-pop shops, entrepreneurs — can compete on a level playing field with the biggest companies."</p><p>Biden called for legislators to offer upstart companies a chance to succeed by bringing in fairer rules. "The next generation of great American companies shouldn’t be smothered by the dominant incumbents before they have a chance to get off the ground," he argued.</p><p>The president also noted that his "administration has made strong progress in promoting competition throughout the economy, consistent with my <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-executive-order-call-for-reinstating-net-neutrality-141029471.html">July 2021 executive order</a>." At that time, he urged the Federal Communications Commission to undo the previous administration's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-14-fcc-repealed-net-neutrality.html">dismantling of net neutrality</a> and said that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html">mergers would face more scrutiny</a>. However, there's only so much the executive branch can do.</p><p>"We need bipartisan action from Congress to hold Big Tech accountable. We’ve heard a lot of talk about creating committees. It’s time to walk the walk and get something done," Biden concluded. "There will be many policy issues we disagree on in the new Congress, but bipartisan proposals to protect our privacy and our children; to prevent discrimination, sexual exploitation and cyberstalking; and to tackle anticompetitive conduct shouldn’t separate us. Let’s unite behind our shared values and show the nation we can work together to get the job done."</p><p>Following the 2022 midterm election, Biden is now contending with a split Congress. Democrats managed to hang onto control of the Senate but lost the House to the Republicans. That will make it more difficult for Biden to carry out his agenda. By publishing an op-ed in a major newspaper, he'll be looking to earn support from the public on these issues and put pressure on Republicans to acquiesce.</p>

<p>Having already returned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-telescope-captures-tarantula-nebula-101518582.html">visually stunning</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-space-telescope-carbon-dioxide-exoplanet-nasa-170059950.html">scientifically spectacular</a> results from its first six months in operation, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-10-billion-james-webb-space-telescope-will-study-universe-origins-180049573.html">James Webb Space Telescope</a> has recorded another inaugural milestone: <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/nasa-s-webb-confirms-its-first-exoplanet">its first exoplanet discovery confirmation</a>. It peered 41 light years into the cosmos and found a planet in the Octans constellation with a diameter 99 percent that of Earth itself — say hello to LHS 475 b.</p><p>Specifically a team of astronomers from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, led by Kevin Stevenson and Jacob Lustig-Yaeger, first spotted evidence of the candidate exoplanet while digging through data  generated from NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a> (TESS). However it was Webb’s <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/nirspec.html">Near-Infrared Spectrograph</a> (NIRSpec) that confirmed the planets existence by observing two transits in front of its parent star.  “There is no question that the planet is there. Webb’s pristine data validate it,” Lustig-Yaeger declared in <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/nasa-s-webb-confirms-its-first-exoplanet">a NASA press release</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7231acee40f64ac8b51435e47cf901cf"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A whole new world!<br /><br />41 light-years away is the small, rocky planet LHS 475 b. At 99% of Earth’s diameter, it’s almost exactly the same size as our home world. This marks the first time researchers have used Webb to confirm an exoplanet. <a href="https://t.co/hX8UGXplq2">https://t.co/hX8UGXplq2</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AAS241?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AAS241</a><a href="https://t.co/SDhuZRfcko">pic.twitter.com/SDhuZRfcko</a></p>— NASA Webb Telescope (@NASAWebb) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAWebb/status/1613240430346264584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>As the space agency notes, among telescopes in operation today (both terrestrial and orbital), only the JWST possesses the resolving capabilities to accurately characterize the atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets. The research team is still working to determine what, if any, sort of atmosphere is sitting atop the rocky mass using by analyzing its <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01F8GF9XGA29AD3QWNPNKMPD1W">transmission spectrum</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a chance that the planet will be devoid of its critical gaseous insulation but at these distances, it could simply be hiding a very small atmo close to the surface. &quot;Counterintuitively, a 100% carbon dioxide atmosphere is so much more compact that it becomes very challenging to detect,” said Lustig-Yaeger.&nbsp;</p><p>They are confident that it does not possess an oppressive atmosphere similar to that of Saturn’s moon Titan, however. “There are some terrestrial-type atmospheres that we can rule out,” he said. “It can’t have a thick methane-dominated atmosphere.”&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the surface of the planet does appear to be around 300 Celsius, several hundred degrees warmer than here on Earth. If cloud cover is discovered in subsequent studies, it could suggest a greenhouse world climate closer to Venus. The researchers have also confirmed that LHS 475 b maintains a tidal-locked orbit with its star of just two days — far too close to attempt with Sol but, because LHS circles a red dwarf that's producing less than half of our sun's energy, can theoretically maintain an atmosphere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> has broken out some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android/"><ins>Android</ins></a> accessibility features into a separate app. Switch Access has graduated from the Android Accessibility Suite and it's now available through the Play Store. Offering Switch Access features via a separate app could allow Google to roll out more frequent updates instead of having to do so at the OS level.&nbsp;</p><p>The move could also let Google offer Switch Access features on older devices too. The app is available on 2017's Android 8 (aka <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-21-android-oreo-unveiled-solar-eclipse.html">Android Oreo</a>) and later.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Switch Access enables users to operate their phone or tablet using means other than the touchscreen, as <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-accessibility-switch-access-app/"><em><ins>Android Police</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes. They can use the front-facing camera to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-face-114800871.html"><ins>control the phone with face gestures</ins></a> or external devices such as a keyboard or buttons connected via USB or Bluetooth. The on-board volume buttons can be used to control other aspects of your phone too.</p><p>Users can set up one or more switches (i.e. the front-facing camera and/or other devices) through the app. They'll be able to define how the app scans their screen for actions they're able to carry out. The app can move between all items one at a time, scan a single row at a time or select a location on the screen using moving lines.</p><p>Switch Access can also assign groups of actions to different switches. Press the corresponding switch for the color around the action you want to access, then keep narrowing things down until you get to the correct element. As <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/01/09/android-switch-access-app/"><em><ins>9To5 Google</ins></em></a> points out, once you select an item, several interaction options will be available, such as select, scroll, copy and paste. A menu at the top of the screen provides access to system-wide settings, notifications, the home screen and a way to record shortcuts for frequent and more complex actions.</p><p>To get started with Switch Access, go to the titular menu in the device's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/accessibility/">accessibility</a> settings. The Switch Access app is free to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.accessibility.switchaccess"><ins>download from the Play Store too</ins></a>.</p>

## Apple finally lets businesses customize their listings in Maps

<p>Apple Maps still isn't likely to replace Google Maps for some users (it only got <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-maps-adds-multi-stop-navigation-routes-in-i-os-16-173303908.html">multi-stop routes</a> last year), but Apple thinks it has another way to shrink the feature gap: give stores more control over what you see. The company has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjMvMDEvaW50cm9kdWNpbmctYXBwbGUtYnVzaW5lc3MtY29ubmVjdC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZiM2U4NGU2LWI1YzMtNDRlMC04MGYyLWJmMjcwN2Y0YmYxOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdazFSZMYGQ5_y0tK7mnMuS1RaEXAVJ8JTs10JuQRiLX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2023%2F01%2Fintroducing-apple-business-connect%2F">launched</a> a free Apple Business Connect tool that lets any firm customize its location cards in apps like Maps, Messages, Siri and Wallet. They can add their own imagery, invite actions in other apps (such as booking a restaurant through OpenTable) or showcase the latest promos.</p><p>Apple will verify businesses before it gives control over a location card, but shops only have to use an Apple ID to sign up. Business Connect is available worldwide, although showcases will only be available in the US at first. They'll reach other countries in the "coming months," the company says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The expansion comes as Apple is rumored to be finding ways to profit from Maps. The iPhone creator is reportedly preparing to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ads-apple-maps-2023-211033899.html">bring search ads to Maps</a> as soon as this year. If that's true, custom store info could help Apple's bottom line — a business might be more likely to pay for ads if it knows they'll lead to more sales.</p><p>Whatever Apple's motivations, the custom cards still promise to improve the Maps experience for everyday users.  You should see more accurate and polished info for local businesses, and have an easier time with everyday tasks like booking a hotel or ordering groceries. It may be more helpful when you share locations with friends in Messages, too. Apple is arguably overdue on this front (businesses have had control over their Google Maps profiles for years), but you may well notice the difference.</p>

## Xbox test feature shuts down your console during scheduled hours to save energy

<p>The sleep mode on modern consoles lets them wake up quickly, but it also consumes a significant amount of energy as the system never really shuts off. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a> thinks it can offer a compromise, however. It's releasing an Insider test that gives <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-review-microsoft-140045437.html">Xbox Series X</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-s-review-140027758.html">Series S</a> and One owners an &quot;active hours&quot; sleep option. Choose that and your console will shut down at times when you aren't likely to use it, cutting your energy use. You can manually schedule the hours if you know when you play, but an automatic option is available if you want the console to adapt to your habits.</p><p>The feature will be automatically enabled and scheduled on Xbox Series X/S systems. The Xbox One will default to always active, and you'll have to configure the hours yourself.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is also introducing a &quot;shutdown (energy saving)&quot; option that reportedly uses up to 20 times less power than sleep while still allowing overnight updates to your Xbox and its games. If you don't mind the longer startup times and the absence of remote wake, you can reduce your energy footprint and potentially shrink your bills. The update will be automatic for Xbox Series X/S users in the Insider program, and it should be available as early as today for One models.</p><p>The Xbox is also borrowing &quot;carbon aware&quot; downloads <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-2022-update-accessibility-170013018.html">from Windows 11</a>. If carbon intensity data is available in your region, the machine will schedule OS and game updates for those times when it's most likely to rely on local renewable energy, rather than simply grabbing files in the early morning. Insiders will have this perk right away if the Xbox Series X/S is configured for automatic updates, while the One will have multiple test options to help with feedback.</p><p>It's unclear how much energy these features might save in the real world. Microsoft estimates that two Xbox consoles using the eco-friendly shutdown feature will save carbon equivalent to that a tree removes in a decade, but that also assumes your device is powered down for 20 hours per day. Carbon aware downloads only matter if renewables have a significant presence in your area, we'd add. Combined with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clean-energy-charging-feature-iphone-ios-16-170238058.html">Apple's Clean Energy Charging</a>, though, it's evident tech brands now see software as a way to advance their environmental goals.</p>

<p>Microsoft's dual-screen Android phones have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-camera-sample-specs-glance-bar-130004036.html">less than successful</a>, to put it mildly, and there are now hints the company is shaking up its mobile strategy. <em>Windows Central</em><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/microsoft-scraps-plans-for-dual-screen-surface-duo-3-pivots-to-new-foldable-screen-design">sources</a> claim Microsoft has cancelled a twin-screen Surface Duo 3, which was reportedly slated for release late this year, and will instead focus on a &quot;true&quot; foldable phone. The new device's specs and name aren't known, but it would have a 180-degree hinge with an outside cover display akin to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivo-x-fold-foldable-phone-183035500.html">Vivo X Fold</a>.</p><p>The cancelled Surface Duo 3 was &quot;finalized,&quot; according to the sources. It would have supposedly addressed some of its predecessor's shortcomings with narrower edge-to-edge screens and wireless charging. Microsoft isn't said to have settled on a release window for the foldable, suggesting that the product is unlikely to arrive in 2023.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The purported insiders also say Microsoft is planning to expand its Android phone offerings. It's apparently &quot;exploring&quot; other form factors, including prototypes of more conventional smartphones.  A software initiative, &quot;Perfect Together,&quot; would also provide tighter integration between Surface phones and Windows, much like the iPhone's close ties to the Mac.</p><p>We've asked Microsoft for comment and will let you know if we hear back. The Surface Duo series has struggled in the market between its high prices (up to $1,500), unreliable software and performance that frequently trails the latest Android flagships. While the dual-screen design has offered some clever multitasking features, it's been a tough sell when rivals like Samsung's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Galaxy Z Fold line</a> have generally been more powerful and trustworthy.</p><p>A foldable Surface phone would put Microsoft into more direct competition with brands like Samsung and Vivo. There's no guarantee it will stand out in a growing field. If the rumored pivot is real, however, it also indicates that Microsoft is still committed to Android devices — it's not giving up just because its first forays failed to gain traction.</p>

## OpenAI will soon test a paid version of its hit ChatGPT bot

<p>If you're eager to use ChatGPT for work, you might soon have the option. OpenAI has shared a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwuQEWBkxsNftEkvUgFx2Ov7pKcrOx8IUlZ241lvet7ziXCQ/viewform">waitlist</a> for a experimental ChatGPT Professional service that, for a fee, would effectively remove the limits on the popular chatbot. The AI tool would always be available, with no throttling and as many messages as necessary. The startup hasn't said when the pilot program might launch, and it's asking would-be participants for feedback on pricing.</p><p>OpenAI isn't shy about the reasoning behind its pro offering. As <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/11/openai-begins-piloting-chatgpt-professional-a-premium-version-of-its-viral-chatbot/">notes</a>, the company said on its Discord server that it's "starting to think" about how it will make money from ChatGPT and keep the technology viable in the "long-term." CEO Sam Altman recently <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=dc008fcb-e3da-4d5b-bfcf-3ffc75d29fd0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Motley+Fool&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkYzAwOGZjYi1lM2RhLTRkNWItYmZjZi0zZmZjNzVkMjlmZDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9vbC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nLzIwMjMvMDEvMTAvbWljcm9zb2Z0LW1heS1pbnZlc3QtMTAtYmlsbGlvbi1pbi1jaGF0Z3B0LXBhcmVudC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjhjNTdlZGM0LTRmYjYtNDNmYy1iMGIxLWYzYmMyM2NiM2QwYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAf7321Db_roIhaD5abLNCHy_7hv3sKfbL9FEbQ9cl9cd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2023%2F01%2F10%2Fmicrosoft-may-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-parent%2F">pointed out</a> that ChatGPT costs OpenAI a few cents for every chat, making it impractical to keep the bot completely free. While <em>Reuters</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/chatgpt-owner-openai-projects-1-billion-revenue-by-2024-sources-2022-12-15/">sources</a> say OpenAI anticipates making $200 million in revenue this year, it also reportedly wants to earn $1 billion in 2024 — subscriptions might play an important role in that growth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether there's a sizable audience for ChatGPT Professional is unclear. The existing version had more than one million users as of early last month, but it's uncertain how many of those are 'serious' users versus enthusiasts and curious onlookers. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-openai-new-york-city-public-schools-ban-192608080.html">Schools</a> and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23540291/chatgpt-ai-writing-tool-banned-writing-academic-icml-paper">AI conferences</a> have banned the bot. Microsoft (a major OpenAI backer) is rumored to be integrating ChatGPT into its Bing search engine as soon as March, however, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/10/some-investors-are-cautiously-implementing-chatgpt-in-their-workflows/">investors</a> have even tried using the technology as part of their workflows. The pilot could be crucial for gauging real-world demand, not to mention setting the prices needed to turn a profit.</p>

People have been reporting delayed flights since at least the evening of January 10th, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-faa-says-flight-personnel-alert-system-not-processing-updates-after-outage-2023-01-11/"><em>Reuters</em></a> says over 400 flights flying within, from and into the US had been delayed as of 5:31AM ET today, January 11th. It's unclear whether the FAA will be able to fully remedy the issue by 9AM. As the news organization notes, a NOTAM contains information that's essential to flight personnel. Some NOTAMs for long-haul international flights could have as many as 200 pages and include details, such as runway closures and low-altitude construction obstacles.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

## The Morning After: Microsoft's VALL-E AI can replicate a voice from a three-second sample

<p>Microsoft’s latest research in text-to-speech AI centers on a new AI model, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-vall-e-ai-can-simulate-any-persons-voice-from-a-short-audio-sample-112520213.html">VALL-E</a>. While there are already multiple services that can create copies of your voice, they usually demand substantial input. Microsoft claims its model can simulate someone's voice from just a three-second audio sample. The speech can match both the timbre and emotional tone of the speaker – even the acoustics of a room. It could one day be used for customized or high-end text-to-speech applications, but like deepfakes, there are risks of misuse.</p><p>Researchers trained VALL-E on 60,000 hours of English language speech from 7,000-plus speakers in Meta's Libri-Light audio library. The results aren’t perfect: Some are tinny machine-like samples, while others are surprisingly realistic.</p><p>Microsoft isn’t making the code open source, possibly due to the inherent risks. In the paper, the company said: "Since VALL-E could synthesize speech that maintains speaker identity, it may carry potential risks in misuse of the model, such as spoofing voice identification or impersonating."</p><p>We’ve all seen the 1992 movie <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PURYV2RqNS1DVGpJIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNzA0ZmU1Ny1lMjVjLTQxOGYtYTRiYy05ZjM2ZWJhNGJjMjEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARNg9PhcV2k8nbeQwYr6mBzl662cBfKExkXCshI9lxAg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDXWdj5-CTjI"><em><ins>Sneakers</ins></em></a>, right?

## Apple Watch ruled to have infringed Masimo's pulse oximeter patent by US judge

<p>In mid-2021, medical technology company Masimo sued Apple over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">Watch Series 6's</a> blood oxygen monitoring capabilities. Masimo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/masimo-apple-watch-series-6-itc-import-ban/">accused</a> the tech giant of infringing on five of its pulse oximeter patents after introducing a device that has the ability to measure blood oxygen saturation. Now, a US International Trade Commission (ITC) judge has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/11/apple-watch-masimo-patent-infringement/">ruled</a> that Apple did indeed infringe on one of Masimo's pulse oximeter patents.&nbsp;</p><p>While the judge has also concluded that the tech giant did not infringe on the other four patents involved in the case, the ITC will now reportedly examine whether to impose an import ban on Apple Watches with the feature, as Masimo had requested when it filed the lawsuit. Newer Apple Watches, namely the Series 7 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-real-world-test-130031046.html">and 8</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-ultra-review-battery-life-compass-gps-hike-130055477.html">Ultra</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-real-world-impressions-test-battery-life-130014165.html">SE</a>, have blood oxygen monitoring features, so the ITC's decision will also affect them.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Masimo CEO Joe Kiani told <a href="https://www.mddionline.com/regulations/masimo-takes-bite-out-apple"><em>MD+DI</em></a> in a statement that his company is happy that the judge &quot;took this critical first step toward accountability.&quot; Kiani continued by saying that &quot;Apple has similarly infringed on other companies' technologies&quot; and that the &quot;ruling exposes Apple as a company that takes other companies' innovations and repackages them.&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple accused Masimo of being the one that copied its intellectual property in its statement to the publication. &quot;At Apple, our teams work tirelessly to create products and services that empower users with industry-leading health, wellness, and safety features. Masimo is&nbsp;attempting to take advantage of these many innovations by introducing a device that copies Apple Watch and infringes on our intellectual property, while also&nbsp;trying to eliminate competition from the market. We respectfully disagree with today’s decision, and look forward to a full review by the commission,&quot; a spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p><p>The judge's decision was only an initial ruling that reflects the ITC's findings during its investigation, and the final ruling for the case won't be handed down until May 10th.&nbsp;</p>

## Twitter begins forcing its TikTok-like 'For You' timeline on iOS

<p>Twitter has started to <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1612966288300572672">roll out a big change</a> on iOS by replacing the &quot;sparkle&quot; button that switches between the algorithmic and reverse chronological feeds. Now, you swipe between two tabs called &quot;For You&quot; and &quot;Following,&quot; to change your timeline, and you'll always see the For You tab first when you open the app.</p><p>The company more or less stole the For You name from TikTok, rather than using the Home moniker it had before. As with Home (and TikTok), it shows tweets from accounts you follow out of order, along with algorithmically-selected tweets from others you may like.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Twitter for iOS now features an algorithmic 'For You' page as the default" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/33309cb0-9192-11ed-b5bf-57d44cb22811" style="height: 2556; width: 2403;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>In fact, Twitter introduced a very similar feature earlier this year, letting you swipe between &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Latest Tweets&quot; to switch timelines.

<p>Apple will begin replacing its mobile devices' displays with its in-house screen technology as soon as next year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/apple-to-begin-making-in-house-screens-in-2024-in-shift-away-from-samsung?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The tech giant will reportedly start with its highest-end Apple Watches in late 2024 and will swap the devices' current OLED screens with its own microLED technology. <em>Bloomberg</em> says Apple's homegrown display tech will also make its way to its other devices, including the iPhone. The new display is brighter with more vibrant colors and will reportedly make it seem as if watchfaces and other content are painted on top of the glass. Plus, it can be viewed better at an angle.</p><p>The publication first reported about Apple's efforts to develop its own display <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-18-apple-microled-rumor.html">way back in 2018</a>. Apparently, Apple was originally working to introduce its technology in 2020, but it was hampered by the costs and technical challenges associated with the development. Those same concerns also prevented the company from including larger displays in its plans and had prompted it to focus on making the Watch the first device with its in-house screen.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite the delay and potential future delays — Apple might push back the display's debut to 2025, <em>Bloomberg's</em> sources said — the technology is one of the company's most critical projects. The tech giant has reportedly spent several billion dollars on its development and is already testing the new screen on an update to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-ultra-review-battery-life-compass-gps-hike-130055477.html">Apple Watch Ultra</a>. It's also test manufacturing the screens in its facility in Santa Clara, California, though it may ultimately outsource its mass production.</p><p>As <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, Apple's shift to its own displays could be a big blow to its suppliers, mainly Samsung and LG. But the manufacturers may have been bracing for it for quite some time now: After all, it's no secret that Apple has been developing its own components in a bid to lessen reliance on third-party companies. It had previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-arm-mac-processor-intel-182826202.html">moved away from Intel processors</a> to its own chips for Mac computers and its reportedly planning to use its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wireless-chips-iphone-to-replace-broadcom-qualcomm-143010106.html">own wireless chipsets</a> in iPhones by 2025.</p>

<p>Parler parent company Parlement Technologies has cut the “majority” of its staff in recent weeks, according to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/10/23549198/parler-parlement-technologies-layoffs-gettr-george-farmer-candace-owens"><ins>new report</ins></a>. <em>The Verge </em>reports that the company has slashed close to 75 percent of staff, including several executives, in recent weeks with “approximately 20” workers remaining between both entities at the end of 2022.</p><p>Parler didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the layoffs or how many staffers remain. The layoffs seem to roughly coincide with other difficulties for the “free speech” social media app. Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, had struck a deal to buy the service for an undisclosed amount <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kanye-west-is-buying-twitter-clone-parler-101627060.html"><ins>in October</ins></a>. In December, Parlement Technologies announced the deal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ye-is-no-longer-buying-parler-the-free-speech-social-media-app-220019626.html"><ins>was off</ins></a>, with a Parler rep claiming the decision had been made in mid-November due to Ye’s “ongoing business difficulties.” Layoffs began shortly after, at the end of November, <em>The Verge </em>now reports.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Parler was originally launched in 2018, but rose to prominence<a href="https://www.engadget.com/parler-free-speech-social-network-rules-180050222.html"><ins> in 2020</ins></a> as several high profile Republicans announced they were leaving Twitter in favor of Parler. The app billed itself as a “free speech” social network that eschewed the “censorship” of mainstream social media platforms like Twitter. It gained popularity as a free-wheeling alternative that had few rules or moderation policies.</p><p>That changed after January 6th 2021, when Amazon, Apple and Google all cut off the app from their services over the company’s inability to address <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-responds-parler-lawsuit-203419366.html"><ins>violent threats</ins></a> on the platform. The app eventually made its way back to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/parler-returns-to-app-store-144753218.html"><ins>Apple</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/parler-app-return-to-android-play-store-191902824.html"><ins>Google’s</ins></a> app stores after implementing substantial changes to its content moderation practices.</p>
