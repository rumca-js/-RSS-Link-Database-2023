The new take hits HBO Max on January 12.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When executive producer and lead Mindy Kaling (The Office, Never Have I Ever) unveiled a first look at the show in 2022, she explained that the show would be <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-look-at-hbo-maxs-velma-adult-animated-series/1100-6503660/\">a major departure from the original Scooby-Doo series</a>. Not only is that cartoon dog nowhere to be found in here, but the crimes Mindy and the rest of the gang investigate will be actual murders.

So, she's forced to bridge cliques and team with popular Daphne (Constance Wu), shallow Fred (Glenn Howerton), and stoner Shaggy (Sam Richardson). The trailer also suggests that Daphne and Velma used to be close friends but are now sworn enemies, navigating an uncomfortable alliance.
