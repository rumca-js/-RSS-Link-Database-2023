<p>This week signals the end of the line for Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 support. After years of extended security updates, no more bugs or security holes will be patched in the venerable operating systems.</p><p>Windows 7 had a good run. When it launched in 2009, it helped Microsoft bounce back from the disastrous Windows Vista era. Windows 8, by contrast, was almost as big of a disaster as Vista but for a different reason. Whereas Vista was bloated and slow, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3575332/the-worst-version-of-windows-ever-released.html">Windows 8 was simply marred by a very bad interface</a> that was universally panned.</p><p>This transition is no different than what we went through last decade with end-of-life support for Windows XP, said Mike Cherry, senior analyst at Directions on Microsoft. “We all understand that even though we have a perpetual license in theory, we’re at the mercy of how long Microsoft focuses on [the version].”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685369/microsoft-finally-ends-windows-7-windows-8-support.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>The FAA said Wednesday evening that a “damaged database file” was the root cause of a systemwide failure in its NOTAM safety information database, which grounded flights across the US for several hours that morning. There was “no evidence of a cyberattack,” according to the agency.</p><p>The ground stop was issued early Wednesday morning, shortly after the NOTAM — or Notice to Air Missions — system crashed, halting departures nationwide even as the airways recover from mass cancellations at Southwest Airlines over the holidays. <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685211/us-flights-resume-after-system-failure-causes-faa-to-halt-air-travel.html">Flights resumed later in the morning.</a></p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685533/database-error-not-cyberattack-led-to-air-travel-stoppage-faa-says.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>As Amazon looks to shed staff around the world, it is heading for a showdown with worker and government representatives over its hotly contested Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) in India.</p><p>Workers say that the program has not been truly voluntary, but rather a way of enacting layoffs without going through legally sanctioned procedures. On its part, Amazon has said that none of the workers who have left the company in the last few months have been laid off, but rather have participated voluntarily in the VSP.</p><p>The company has not revealed the number of workers it says have recently left the company via the VSP.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pune Labor Commission has summoned representatives from Amazon India and the Pune-based Nascent Information Technology Employees Senaten (NITES), a workers rights association, to a joint meeting on January 17. Pune is the largest municipal district in the state of Maharashtra, and a major IT hub for the country.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685411/amazon-to-face-off-with-workers-government-on-staff-reduction-in-india.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
