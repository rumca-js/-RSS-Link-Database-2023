<p>In the minds of the optimists occupying the boardroom at Stamford Bridge, there will come a point when Chelsea will be able to look back on the night when they lost to Fulham for the first time in 17 years and laugh about the time their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/11/atletico-madrid-joao-felix-chelsea-loan-diego-simeone">new signing from Atlético Madrid</a> took it too far with his attempts to prove he was capable of handling the rough and tumble of English football.</p><p>Yet the problem with that theory, the one that involves west London’s third best club being rewarded for sticking by Graham Potter, is that it jars with the current reality. For all the talk of trusting the process, Chelsea lie 10th in the table and six points behind Fulham. There was defiance from Potter’s team, epitomised by Kalidou Koulibaly’s equaliser, but it all fell apart after João Felix marred a promising debut with a ludicrous red card. Carlos Vinícius would soon deepen the woe for Chelsea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/12/fulham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

But reality is different: save, perhaps, an airport, there’s nowhere safer to start a row than on a Premier League pitch, because the chances of reprisals are almost zero. Consider, for example, Martin Keown and Ruud van Nistelrooy: jumping on someone from behind works well in football’s posturing pantomime, but in a square go the sensible money would be on the martial artist able to exercise self-control because he knows there’s no serious threat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/12/lisandro-martinez-hostility-agility-help-bring-steel-back-manchester-united">Continue reading...</a>

## Beware the ‘spare’: let’s drop the need for a second-in-line, and let Harry be the last | Kate Williams

<p>Heirs’ early deaths are lot less common these days, so Britain should copy European royalty and let No 2s work unimpeded</p><p>“My family had declared me a nullity. The Spare,” declares Prince Harry in his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/10/spare-prince-harry-review-attempt-reclaim-narrative">new memoir</a>, frustrated in a history lesson at Eton that the teacher expected him to know the story of Charles Edward Stuart. He doesn’t want to think about it, doesn’t want to know about history – “Why memorise the names of past spares?”. And yet he has: they thread through his book, unspoken. Not just Princess Margaret (who he notes once gave him a Biro for Christmas), all the others who were No 2, and those who are to come. Harry was, as he sees it, “brought into the world in case something happened to Willy”.</p><p>“The heir and the spare” was, he tells us, a “shorthand” about the two brothers used by the entire family, and says it was what Charles told Diana after his birth. The word “spare” is repeated so much that it is almost dizzying – and recurs in the most heated incidents. When, he said, William pushed him, his brother was “in full heir mode and couldn’t fathom why I wasn’t dutifully playing the role of the spare”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/12/spare-prince-harry-second-in-line-european-royalty">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Hindrich/Sólyom-Nagy/Pushniak/Staatskapelle Weimar/Beykirch<br />(Audite, two CDs)<br /></strong>One of the German Democratic Republic’s most significant composers used his opera about a dragon and a knight to question the regime</p><p>P<a href="https://www.milkenarchive.org/artists/view/paul-dessau">aul Dessau</a> was one of the most significant composers in the German Democratic Republic. Having grown up in Germany, Dessau spent the second world war years in the US, composing film scores before returning to the newly formed GDR in 1948, where he worked with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bertolt-brecht">Bertolt Brecht’s</a> Berliner Ensemble. Though his first opera, The Trial of Lucullus, was condemned by the Communist party for its formalism soon after its 1951 premiere, Dessau rapidly became an influential figure in the musical life of the GDR. Despite all his state honours his music was never circumscribed by party orthodoxy; he encouraged younger East German composers to make contact with their counterparts in the west, and invited figures such as Hans Werner Henze, Luigi Nono and Aribert Reimann to visit him in Berlin.</p><p>Dedicated to “everyone who fights and works for socialism in our republic”, Dessau’s third opera, Lanzelot was first performed at the Berlin Staatsoper in 1969 to mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the GDR. Heiner Müller and Ginka Tcholakova’s libretto was based on a fairytale by the Soviet writer Evgeny Schwartz; a city ruled by a dragon is liberated by the knight, Lanzelot. But the inhabitants had lived comfortably under the totalitarian rule, and with Lanzelot presumed dead, set up another group to succeed the dragon. But the knight is only wounded, and eventually returns to release the city’s prisoners and overthrow the new regime, posing the question of whether the liberated society will be able to survive without totalitarianism. Dessau maintained that the target of this allegory was US imperialism, but its message can hardly have been mistaken by the leaders of the Soviet bloc.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/12/dessau-lanzelot-review-a-gleefully-eclectic-attack-on-soviet-totalitarianism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A brisk, well-structured horror from Scream writer Kevin Williamson finds shock and gore in the early days of Covid lockdown</p><p>One of the early surprises of Sick, a tight and serviceable slasher flick from the Scream writer Kevin Williamson, is not the numerous jump scares nor stalker set-up but how triggering it is to hear Anderson Cooper’s voice describe 98% of the US population in lockdown. The pandemic never really ended, but there’s a specific era of early Covid that has distinctly passed and remains, for most people, locked in a memory box somewhere – a time of fear, uncertainty, contempt, callousness, Clorox-ing groceries, and inescapable (and incredulous) news reports, also known as April 2020.</p><p>Sick, directed by John Hyams and now streaming on Peacock, explicitly takes the horror of pre-vaccine, first-wave Covid shutdown – 273,880 cases and rising on 3 April, according to an intro slide – as its starting point. A college-age single guy named Tyler (Joel Courtney) performs the ritual of masking and sanitation for trawling empty grocery shelves. There’s no toilet paper. A woman holding a baby guilt-trips her way into the last box of tissues. Taped arrows on the floor offer an illusion of control. And a random number texting Tyler turns sinister.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/12/sick-review-covid-kevin-willianson-scream">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Polydor)<br /></strong>Using a limited, hook-free palette of mid-tempo beats, mournful piano figures and samples, Cian Wright illustrates the paranoia and interminable grind of his world</p><p>There have been a variety of theories posited about the steady but inexorable rise of 23-year-old Cian Wright, from viral sensation – thanks to a 40-second clip of him leaning out of a car window, rapping with such so-what detachment that you keep expecting him to shrug – to the Top 10. He submits one himself on his debut mixtape as Clavish. “I don’t even rap,” he says. “I illustrate”.</p><p>Listening to Rap Game Awful, you see what he means. His worldview is strikingly drawn and bleak, devoid of politicking, expressions of anger at societal injustice or indeed optimism: this is just what it’s like, he seems to say, and it’s unlikely to change. Life on the streets is an endless, numbing round of cheffings and nittys and opps getting splashed, “anxiety through the roof”. Reputations are built on acts of violence that he seems to grasp are pointless (“What a goal,” he deadpans after describing stabbing a “little dickhead” while friends cheer his character on) and the fear of imminent death is constant. Jail, he suggests on Monday to Sunday, can feel like an upgrade, on the grounds that you’re less likely to get killed behind bars: “I’d rather them birded off than graveyard visits.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/12/clavish-rap-game-awful-review-rising-rapper-conjures-a-haunting-despondent-mood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anna Makievska’s The Bakehouse was one of the first to spearhead sourdough in Ukraine. Here, she shares the importance of kneading and baking – and the recipe for her signature loaf</p><p>Bread baking has always been an act of creation for me. And I hadn’t considered myself a creator before I baked my first sourdough bread. The bakery I co-founded and named The Bakehouse is an artisan bakery in Kyiv, Ukraine. We have baked sourdough bread and made delicious pastries since 2015. We were pioneers of sourdough long-fermented bread in Ukraine, and in October 2021 we finally opened our very new bakery – Bakehouse Garage – in the Podil district of Kyiv. This is the bakery of my dreams, and we spent three years and US$1.5m building it. But during the first days of the war, we had attacks and explosions just a few kilometres away, so we had to close it on 24 February.

<p>Though ending charitable status is safe ground for Labour, only structural change will bridge education inequality</p><p>That high-pitched noise you can hear in the distance is the sound of the Daily Mail weeping with relief. On Wednesday, the Labour party attempted to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/11/labour-look-to-force-vote-on-ending-private-schools-tax-breaks">force a binding vote</a> on ending private schools’ tax breaks. The motion to set up a new committee to investigate private schools’ “charitable status” failed by 303 to 197, but in many ways Keir Starmer got what he wanted: he<strong> </strong>skewered the government’s record on education, and highlighted unrest among staff. The £1.7bn a year that would be raised by scrapping tax breaks – which include 80% relief on business rates and exemption from VAT on school fees – Starmer pointed out, could be used to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-private-school-tax-breaks-b2259932.html?amp">recruit 6,500 new teachers</a>. </p><p>It is a smart move to frame ending private schools’ tax breaks as a means to improve the quality of state education. A staggering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/oct/22/exclusive-90-of-uk-schools-will-go-bust-next-year-heads-warn?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">nine out of 10 schools</a> in England will run out of money by the next school year owing to the burden of increased energy and salary bills. While state school teachers are having to <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1573177/schools-crisis-books-education-limited-budget/amp">buy their own class books</a>, it feels particularly obscene to spend public money helping wealthy parents buy more advantage.

<p>Lisa Rinna leaving the franchise sparked a wave of communication from concerned friends, while asking which version someone prefers is the perfect ice-breaker. Welcome to Real Housewives obsession</p><p>Where were you when Lisa Rinna left Real Housewives? I was in Budapest on a spa break intended to start the new year with a clean slate and empty mind. This stab at tranquility was interrupted on the third morning when I woke to a flurry of notifications from frenzied gays – had I heard the news? After eight years as a Real Housewife of Beverly Hills, agitator-in-chief Lisa had been let go. Attempting to elicit some kind of response from my sleepy boyfriend, I may have referred to this history-changing development as “our moon landing”.</p><p>For gay people, the Real Housewives franchise has become a uniting force. It binds disparate groups – from Canal Street twinks to Stockwell bears – with a shared interest and common parlance. It is football for gays; a fast track to intimacy between men with little else in common. “Are you up to date on (Real Housewives of) Potomac” has become our “did you see the match?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/12/for-gays-this-is-our-moon-landing-the-unadulterated-camp-joy-of-real-housewives">Continue reading...</a>

The aesthetic isn’t far from a handheld Pokémon or Zelda, immediately inviting and comfortable to play around in.</p><p>In this colourful, clever RPG, rather than using swords and sorcery to forge our way through a fantasy world, we play in resort towns populated by athletes who can teach us new sports – tennis, BMX, cricket, football. There are, of course, also malign forces at work: a menacing corporation buying up local greenways, and a sort of athletic mafia that hampers the player’s journey. What begins as a relaxing vacation with sunny beaches and glitzy malls soon takes us into dark silver mines full of puzzles to solve and citizens to help.</p><p>Sports Story is out now; £12.80</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/12/sports-story-review-all-the-charm-of-a-forgotten-snes-classic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pupils investigate a murder at school in this entertaining noir lite for young readers</p><p>Detective stories for 9+ have boomed in the past decade, thanks to Robin Stevens’ bestselling Murder Most Unladylike series. They’ve also evolved from Enid Blyton-style cosiness to noir lite: these are morally complex stories, in which deadly violence has a lingering emotional impact. Young readers who devour Fleur Hitchcock’s Murder at Snowfall or Sharna Jackson’s High-Rise Mystery display an appetite both for satisfying puzzles and carefully gauged realism.</p><p>Lis Jardine’s first novel is a compelling addition to the new canon. A family relocation to Bristol finds Jonno Archer resentfully enrolled at Hanbridge High; missing his friends, he decides to behave so badly that his parents reconsider the move. When he and another boy discover their PE teacher’s body in the sports shed, Jonno is initially horrified – until he realises that investigating a murder might prove top-grade misbehaviour.</p><p>The Detention Detectives by Lis Jardine is published by Puffin (£7.99).

<p>Generations after scientists found that lead was dangerous to humans, American infrastructure is still rife with lead: homes, water pipes, automobile fuel and more. This means an astounding number of America's most vulnerable children have high levels of lead in their blood. To understand why lead has been so difficult to remove from one of the world's wealthiest nations, we have to understand just how obsessed America was with lead – and how the industry spread propaganda about the benefits of lead, even after research showed it was dangerous.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2023/jan/12/the-gift-of-god-that-has-poisoned-american-kids-for-100-years">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC; Lemaitre Bros<br /></strong>Oppressive lo-fi visuals and brutalist architecture somehow create a game of laidback curiosity and exploration</p><p>Babbdi’s secret weapon is a trumpet. Unearthed from a tower above a stagnant dockyard, it’s an unexpected comic flourish in what looks like a lo-fi brutalist horror game. Making music is simple: hold left mouse button until your breath runs out, change pitch with the cursor. If you like, you can try tootling along to an in-game radio. The trumpet won’t help you navigate Babbdi’s vertiginous architecture – best search for the climbing axe, instead – but it’s hard to put down. It transforms this world-weary first-person platformer into a game about testing the acoustics of abandoned spaces: melancholy but joyful.</p><p>Released for free over Christmas by little-known French developer Lemaitre Bros, Babbdi is a slender masterwork that cuts you adrift in a small, forsaken city. The only thing it requires you to do is leave, which is easy enough. Naturally, this heightens the intrigue. So many video game environments feel disposable – just so much scenery to ignore or blow up while chasing a foe or a waypoint – yet they are seldom actively introduced as such. What could this one be hiding?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/12/babbdi-review-a-moody-urban-wander-straight-off-a-playstation-1-demo-disc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our world is created for us by our senses, but understanding how they work, and why they often fool us, is not just common sense</p><p>If you are ambitious to found a new science, measure a smell,” said Alexander Graham Bell to a graduating class in 1914. A century later, scientists are still working on it. But it’s not just smell that remains difficult to define and categorise. Humans can calculate pi to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/aug/16/swiss-researchers-calculate-pi-to-new-record-of-628tn-figures">trillions of digits</a>, but can we agree on what the colour teal is? Or whether coriander tastes nice? Or when pleasant stroking becomes annoying tickling? The mildly unnerving point is that much of the information we learn through our senses cannot be objectively measured. Colour “doesn’t actually exist outside of our brains … there is also no sound, or taste, or smell … it’s the brain that construes them.”</p><p>“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/03/kylieminogue.popandrock">How do you describe a feeling?</a>”, asked Kylie Minogue in 2007. In this book, Ashley Ward, the author of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/19/the-social-lives-of-animals-by-ashley-ward-review-be-more-bat">The Social Lives of Animals</a> and a professor in animal behaviour at the University of Sydney, uses a rollercoaster combination of science, cultural history, romance, philosophy and schoolboy humour. “But what is beauty?” he wonders, quickly running through the views of Plato, Aristotle, David Hume and Immanuel Kant before pointing out that “men with more symmetrical features have more sex, with more people”. Whether or not you like coriander depends on which variation you have of a single gene, OR6A2. If you want to know what teal looks like you should ask a woman – they have “a greater ability to distinguish between closely matched colours” than men. The ideal rate of stroking is 3cm to 5cm a second – according to recent research using robots with paint brushes – at which our heart rate slows, our blood pressure drops and our brains release natural painkillers and opioids. And if you want to witness how our senses can influence our unconscious bias, try asking volunteers to make moral judgments about a potential out-group after dousing the research room with fart spray. The disgusting smell makes them more prejudiced, even if they don’t notice it’s there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/12/sensational-a-new-story-of-our-senses-by-ashley-ward-review-a-vivid-exploration">Continue reading...</a>

## Poor Harry: even Americans are getting bored with his tell-all tour | Emma Brockes

<p>Watching Harry do the rounds of US chat shows, I felt a sense of pity for the man who will never be more than a sideshow here</p><p>It is ill-advised to form judgments based on the behaviour of a talkshow audience, a group whose sympathies – stoked by hours of anticipation and the sunken cost of a day off work – would rally for any guest above the level of a pot plant. Still, after a week of intense media coverage in the US, Prince Harry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/11/grief-taliban-royal-todger-prince-harry-bares-all-stephen-colbert-interview">stepping out</a> before a studio audience on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Tuesday night was the first sight we had of him interacting with something approximating the American public.</p><p>For days, American news outlets had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/07/prince-harry-book-autobiography-spare-us">speculated</a> that the rollout around Spare was becoming overblown. But that night in New York, the audience heaved to its feet and gave the 38-year-old “husband, father, military veteran and activist”, per Colbert’s introduction, a warm standing ovation. Harry smiled sheepishly. It was, for British observers, deeply, unsettlingly odd.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/12/americans-bored-prince-harry-pity-sideshow">Continue reading...</a>

## There is no ‘T’ in SA20 and maybe no future for venerable South Africa Test side | Andy Bull

<p>From now on everything will be geared around making a success of the latest 20-over franchise – it’s quite a risk</p><p>The future arrived at a quarter to three on a miserable Tuesday afternoon in January. It was ushered in live on Sky Sports Cricket by Mark Nicholas. He was at Newlands where Paarl Royals were playing the Mumbai Indians Cape Town in the first game of the new SA20. According to the league commissioner, Graeme Smith, they dropped the ‘T’ from ‘T20’ deliberately. There are a lot of these leagues out there now and, Smith said, the South Africans hoped this would help theirs stand out from the crowd. Another starts in the UAE on Friday when the Dubai Capitals play the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in the opening game of the ILT20.</p><p>Indian Premier League teams have invested heavily in both competitions. They own all six of the South African sides and three of the UAE’s. Think of the new competitions like the offshoots from the CSI TV series. This was IPL: South Africa.

## Velma review – Scooby Doo’s brainy bud gets a spunky re-imagining

<p>Mindy Kaling reintroduces the animated mystery-solver for an older audience and gives her a string of fun, spooky and sly new adventures</p><p>There was always something about Velma, the brainy and bespectacled teen sleuth in the Scooby Doo gang. After decades of speculation over her romantic leanings, <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/scooby-doo-velma-lesbian-gay-1235392668/">a 2022 Scooby Doo movie</a> confirmed that Velma is, indeed, a lesbian. The Saturday morning cartoon icon is back, still with the pumpkin-colored turtleneck and potbelly, now wearing Martin Scorsese glasses and anchoring an anarchically funny eight-part spinoff series.</p><p>The latest iteration barely bats an eye at the sexuality storyline. Helmed and voiced by Mindy Kaling, the new Velma is too quick and dry-witted to get bogged down with the yearnings of a cartoon character – or, for that matter with any single subject. In Kaling’s immensely enjoyable and zippy reimagining, Velma is crudely drawn proof that life is too short to pledge loyalty to overarching themes or storylines. A master of moving fast and freewheeling (during lockdown she released The Sex Lives of College Girls and Never Have I Ever, all while establishing a book imprint with Amazon and having a second baby), Kaling brings her A-game to this goofy project, which she made with Charlie Grandy, her longtime collaborator.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/12/velma-review-mindy-kaling-scooby-doo">Continue reading...</a>

## Avalon by Nell Zink review – the misfit’s tale

<p>A young woman journeys from criminal family to the artistic precariat, in the latest novel from one of America’s most exciting writers</p><p>Bran, the narrator of Nell Zink’s latest novel,<em> </em>is abandoned by her parents as a child, and grows up in southern California with the criminal family of her mother’s ex-boyfriend, the Hendersons.<strong> </strong>From early childhood she is used by them as unpaid labour in the plant nursery they run as a front operation. It’s a world of gang-affiliated bikers and exploited immigrant labourers, where Bran sleeps in an unheated lean-to and lives on canned food warmed with propane. But, in the way of fictional characters, Bran is meant for better things, and the book<strong> </strong>describes her haphazard rise into the ranks of the middle-class artistic precariat.</p><p>Zink is both a very satisfying and a frustrating writer. Her plots are shapeless but oddly propulsive. Her narrative style is a tissue of quips that strays into glibness, even in her best work. Within it, though, something more substantial is always implicit, and now and then she turns and directly addresses it with a clarity that feels almost violent. Her writing often has a slapdash manner that suggests she’s too authentic to waste sweat on anything as cheap as fiction, and this has the interesting quality of making the reader feel more authentic, too. All these things are present in Avalon<em>, </em>and make it a pleasure, as all Zink’s work is. But one other Zink hallmark goes badly awry here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/12/avalon-by-nell-zink-review-the-misfits-tale">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As my father’s son, I have discovered the pleasures of sharing random bits of interesting information with people – regardless of what we’re talking about </p><p>Just before Christmas I stumbled on a random but interesting fact about something. I felt certain that said fact wasn’t widely known, and so everybody – apart from the cleverest of clever dicks – would find it diverting. I was in a hurry to share; such a hurry, in fact, that I found it frustrating to conform to conversational norms. You know, finding a way of steering the subject matter into the right area so you can lob in your fact-bomb all casual-like.</p><p>I resolved instead to just drop it in, apropos of nothing at all, whenever it suited me. My inspiration for this was my dad, who is only too happy to come out with random stuff completely out of the blue. For example: “Did you know that UHT milk is much improved? It now tastes like normal milk, so there’s no point buying normal milk any more.” At first I found this kind of thing from him amusing, then annoying. But ultimately I felt envious. How liberating just to be able to come right out with it.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/12/not-a-lot-of-people-know-that-i-cant-help-dropping-juicy-facts-into-conversations">Continue reading...</a>

He was transferred from a jail in another county to the jail where I work, where he has never been before, and I’ve been asked to see him for a psychiatric assessment.</p><p>As I review his chart, a pattern slowly emerges. An older Black man, Mr C has been arrested a few times over the years, typically for vague charges such as trespassing or disorderly conduct that are difficult to interpret. Is he truly menacing to people around him, or is he just trying to survive while living on the streets? He has little history of mental illness or substance use, except for an issue that seems to arise whenever he is brought to jail: he starts yelling that he doesn’t want to live any more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/12/homeless-mental-health-illness-prison-incarcerate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An expansive new exhibition pulls together the wild and daring work of an artist who overcame Nazi Germany and a range of maladies to become a one-of-a-kind talent</p><p>Among the names represented by powerhouse gallerist Sean Kelly is Marina Abramović, the Serbian conceptual and performance artist who has collaborated with James Franco and Jay-Z, and whose blockbuster MoMA exhibition The Artist is Present gave her fans an opportunity to sit across from the star and stare into her bewitching eyes. And now it’s time to celebrate another member of the Kelly stable, German multimedia artist Rebecca Horn, born just two years before Abramović, whose body of work is no less groundbreaking and dramatic.</p><p>A new exhibition focusing on Horn’s drawings, now on view at Sean Kelly Gallery in New York before it moves to the gallery’s Los Angeles location, functions as a primer on her furious talent and unfettered imagination. Butterflies and bondage, pianos and poetry, fingernails and feathers are just some of the images that obsess Horn and appear in her creations. Behind every piece that she has engineered over the past five decades – such as the self-inflating and self-deflating straitjacket, or the stunning feathered wheel that transforms its wearer into a winged fantastical creature – were the drawings that she used to work through her sparks of inspiration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/12/she-conducted-her-life-like-it-mattered-the-bold-drawings-of-rebecca-horn">Continue reading...</a>

After alarm over the loss of the ozone layer in the 1980s, governments signed the Montreal protocol in 1987, an international agreement that has helped eliminate 99% of ozone-depleting chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons that were used as solvents and refrigerants.</p><p>Since then, scientists have been monitoring levels of CFCs in the atmosphere and ozone depletion.

He was a political operative of the highest order. Little wonder present and past prime ministers have lauded his career. They know a political asset when they see one.</p><p>Pell’s style of leadership was “old school” – authoritarian and uncompromising. It portrayed an absolutist and unflinching approach of the church to modern life. He was an ideological and cultural warrior within the church that resisted the changes of liberal society and its tolerance for diversity and individualism. His brand of Catholicism has proved to be unpopular and alienating to most Australians. His public persona became a lightening rod for discontent on many social issues, particularly those related to child sexual abuse. By his own design he was perceived as the head of the church in Australia and he bore the brunt of any anti-Catholic sentiment, justified or not.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2023/jan/12/george-pells-death-symbolises-the-demise-of-a-church-out-of-touch-and-out-of-time">Continue reading...</a>
