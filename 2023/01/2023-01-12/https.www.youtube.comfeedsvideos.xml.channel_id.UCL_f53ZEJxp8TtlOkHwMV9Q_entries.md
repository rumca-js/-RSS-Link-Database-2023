Dr Jordan B Peterson and his daughter Mikhaila Peterson explain the current situation with the College of Psychologists of Ontario. They have presented Dr. Peterson with an ultimatum- take part in re-education courses aiming to correct his “wrongthink”, or lose his clinical psychology license. This is unprecedented, totally unjust, and will not be taken lying down.

Mikhaila Peterson is a CEO and the host of “The Mikhaila Peterson Podcast.” As well as interviews, she hosts a series called Opposing Views, where she speaks to people with differing opinions on contentious issues to let listeners make up their own minds. She’s used a diet called the Lion Diet to heal from autoimmune and mood disorders and has educated people on that diet via TEDx and Oxford Union speeches.

Mikhaila is also the founder of the upcoming online education platform Peterson Academy, an online education place devoid of ideology, launching in 2023.

Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh
