Since then, the company has applied the branding to both electrified versions of conventional designs like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqb-first-drive-video-140054170.html\">the EQB</a> as well as unique models like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-suv-ev-review-video-140100977.html\">EQS SUV.</a> Concept cars like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-vision-eqxx-first-drive-video-070023887.html\">long-range EQXX</a> have similarly stuck to the nomenclature.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mercedes-drop-eq-product-brand-handelsblatt-2023-01-12/\">statement</a> to <em>Reuters</em>, a Mercedes spokesperson said it was &quot;too early&quot; to divulge plans. However, the representative said the automaker would &quot;adapt&quot; the use of the EQ brand as it transitioned to an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-plans-to-go-fully-electric-by-the-end-of-the-decade-171002680.html\">all-EV lineup by 2030</a>. The identification still plays a key role in the company's current electric vehicle strategy, the spokesperson added.</p><p>If the report is true, the rethink won't come as a surprise. While car manufacturers have frequently used names to highlight electric powerplants, such as the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-bolt-euv-review-video-160016098.html\">Chevy Bolt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-gt-first-drive-video-150011920.html\">Ford Mustang Mach-E</a>, they're starting to rely on more traditional monikers as EVs become more commonplace. Chevy's upcoming <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gm-2024-chevrolet-blazer-ev-ss-rs-023052241.html\">electric Blazer</a> is one example.

This is made possible by the processor's Thermal Velocity Boost feature, which allows the chip to run faster when it\u2019s cool enough.</p><p>The i9-13900KS is an upgraded version of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/intel-13th-gen-cpus-raptor-lake-162054801.html\">i9-13900K</a>, which Intel released last fall. The main differences between the two processors are that the older chip reached a maximum speed of 5.8GHz and had a lower base power of 125W compared to 150W in the new chip. However, the i9-13900KS has the same number of cores (24), amount of cache (36MB) and number of PCIe lanes (20) as the i9-13900K. In addition, the new processor is compatible with Z790 and Z690 motherboards; however, an updated BIOS is recommended.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Thermal Velocity Boost is a feature in 11th Gen and later Intel Core chips that lets them run faster when they\u2019re cool. It does this by increasing the clock frequency by 100 MHz when the temperature is below a threshold of 70 degrees C. However, you'll need a good cooling solution to get the most out of it.</p><p>This release comes before the launch of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-7000-mobile-cpus-16-core-033046361.html\">AMD's Ryzen 9 7950X3D</a>, which is set to be released in February. The Ryzen 9 7950X3D can reach standard speeds of 5.7GHz and has 144MB of 3D V-Cache technology, which allows for more cache to be added to the CPU.

At the moment, the only known compatible monitors are the Garmin HRM-Dual and the Polar H10 chest straps, but other brands and models (even smartwatches) may be able to pair with the headset. Meta just can't confirm if they'll work with the Quest as it intended.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Meanwhile, Health Connect integration will give users the capability to automatically sync VR workouts with their Android device.

Now, Android users can finally see their progress without having to put on the Quest, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The Health Connect API enables health and fitness data sharing across devices and between apps, such as Samsung Health and MyFitnessPal.

Users will then have to toggle on \"Health Connect by Android\" under the Connected Apps section inside the Meta Quest mobile app.</p><p>It's unclear if these features are also making their way to the first Quest model released under the Oculus branding.
