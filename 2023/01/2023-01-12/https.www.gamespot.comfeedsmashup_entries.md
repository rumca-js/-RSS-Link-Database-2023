## Shazam! Fury of the Gods: Latest Trailer, Plot Details, And Everything We Know

<p>Things may finally be settling down in the DC movie-verse under new DC Studios bosses James Gunn and Peter Safran, but the next new DC film was put together before they took over: Shazam! Fury of the Gods, the sequel to one of the DCEU's better movies.</p><p dir="ltr">Fury of the Gods is in a bit of an awkward spot, arriving after months of drama about Henry Cavill's status as Superman (he no longer has any) and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's reported failed attempt to turn Black Adam into a centerpiece of the DCEU. Both of those stories affect Shazam!--Black Adam is, quite literally, a Shazam! character, and Superman--to whom Shazam has a similar level of power--was mentioned over and over again in the first Shazam! flick before making a brief, head-out-of-frame cameo at the end.</p><p dir="ltr">As it is, Shazam! Fury of the Gods exists in a sort of limbo. The film certainly wasn't built as part of Gunn's and Safran's vision for the franchise, since it was filmed well before they took charge. And whatever big picture plan the DCEU had when the movie was shot no longer exists with Gunn and Safran taking over.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-latest-trailer-plot-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6510540/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A new report claims that technology giants Google and Nvidia have expressed some concerns about Microsoft's proposed buyout of Activision Blizzard. The FTC has sued Microsoft to try to stop the deal, and the case is now headed to court following a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-hearing-in-microsoft-activision-ftc-showdown-scheduled-for-january-3/1100-6510243/">pre-trial hearing earlier this month</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-12/google-nvidia-express-concerns-to-ftc-about-microsoft-s-activision-deal?leadSource=uverify wall">Bloomberg</a> reported that "Google and Nvidia provided information that backs a key FTC contention," which is that Microsoft would claim an unfair advantage specifically in the areas of mobile gaming, subscriptions, and the cloud.</p><p>The report goes on to say that Nvidia told the FTC that there is a "need for equal and open access" to games. The company does not, however, directly oppose the deal, the report said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-nvidia-have-concerns-about-microsofts-deal-to-buy-activision-blizzard-report/1100-6510541/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Immortality writer and director Sam Barlow is considering returning to a more traditional video game format, using 3D models to create an explorable world.</p><p>According to an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-immortality-sam-barlow-is-thinking-about-3d-game-development-again">IGN</a>, Barlow is pondering new directions for the studio's future projects. Barlow's past three projects--Her Story, Telling Lies, and Immortality--have all incorporated full motion video, tasking players with uncovering a story by watching video clips featuring real-world sets and actors. Before going independent with Her Story, and forming the studio Half Mermaid, Barlow worked on a variety of more traditional games, like Silent Hill: Shattered Memories and Serious Sam: Next Encounter.</p><p>In fact, Barlow says that during the development of Immortality, Half Mermaid did some pre-production for a 3D game. The work didn't solidify into a concrete project or prototype, but it shows the interest was there in the studio. Barlow described the pitch as a "perfect smooch" between "a 3D character game" and "all of that Her Story, Immortality stuff."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/immortality-director-considering-using-graphics-rather-than-actors-and-sets-for-his-next-title/1100-6510542/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## New League Of Legends Cinematic Is So Bad, Riot Is Officially Apologizing For It

<p>The latest season of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/">League of Legends</a> is off to the races, but a new cinematic trailer meant to hype up players for the year to come looks to have had the opposite effect, with developer Riot Games since acknowledging the trailer "missed the mark."</p><p dir="ltr">Every year since 2018, Riot has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDYqT0_9VR4">stunning cinematic</a> to kick off each new League of Legends season. However, the cinematic for the 2023 season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/league-of-legends-the-brink-of-infinity-season-2023-cinematic/2300-6460347/">The Brink of Infinity</a>, has not landed particularly well. Whereas previous cinematics featured epic battles, sweeping vistas that showed off the League of Legends universe, and a chance to see many of the game's iconic champions in a new light, this year's cinematic is essentially a two-minute flythrough of the game's Summoner's Rift map accompanied by a voiceover.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans quickly noticed the disparity between this year's cinematic and the ones from previous years, and wasted no time in voicing their displeasure. That prompted Riot to acknowledge the controversy in a thread of <a href="https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1612917295134957569?s=20&amp;t=7Kywn-e93pciMXC2aGtwaA">tweets</a>. Citing "unprecedented circumstances," Riot stated it chose an "alternate approach to the Season 2023 video" that it thought would still celebrate the League of Legends universe and the game's competitive spirit.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-league-of-legends-cinematic-is-so-bad-riot-is-officially-apologizing-for-it/1100-6510536/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">At the Television Critics Association press tour, FX chairman of content and productions John Landgraf discussed the Alien series, from writer/producer Noah Hawley (Fargo). The show was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fx-is-developing-an-alien-series/1100-6485378/">originally announced in December 2020</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's gearing up for production this year after [Hawley] completes production on the fifth season of Fargo," Landgraf said.</p><p dir="ltr">At the TCA in 2021, Landgraf said that the series will be "grounded" and "very conscious" of the existing cinematic universe, "and while it has some flexibility, the aesthetic that was established by Ridley Scott and continued by James Cameron is a part of that universe." By August last year, Hawley had turned in all the scripts for the limited series spin on the sci-fi franchise. But, aside from the series hewing closer to the first original films, that's all Landgraf wanted to share.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fxs-alien-tv-series-will-film-this-year/1100-6510535/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Tom Cruise "Really Didn't Want To" Make Another Top Gun Movie, Director Says

<p>Tom Cruise "really didn't want to" make another Top Gun, director Joseph Kosinski said in a new interview, but he was eventually drawn to return after a script pitch that got him on board for Top Gun: Maverick. It all ended up pretty well for Cruise and company, as Top Gun: Maverick earned $1.5 billion globally. Cruise himself is said to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-cruise-planning-a-wild-world-first-stunt-in-his-new-space-movie/1100-6508212/">made $100 million</a> from the success of Maverick.</p><p><a href="https://deadline.com/2023/01/top-gun-maverick-joseph-kosinski-interview-1235215261/">Speaking to Deadline</a>, Kosinski said that the death of Tony Scott, who directed the 1986 original Top Gun, also played a role in Cruise's hesitance to come back.</p><p>"Tom really didn't want to make another<i> </i>Top Gun and [director Tony Scott's suicide] made it even less likely. I'm sure for him, that's probably another reason why he wouldn't ever consider going back," Kosinski said. "But I pitched the idea of this story being a reconciliation between him and Rooster set against this mission that would take Rooster into this very dangerous situation, that they'd end up together across enemy lines, having to resolve their differences and work together to get back home."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-cruise-really-didnt-want-to-make-another-top-gun-movie-director-says/1100-6510532/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Marvel Snap Card With The Worst Win-Rate Might Surprise You

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-snap/">Marvel Snap</a> features hundreds of cards with unique powers and effects inspired by the Marvel universe, but which cards have the best and worst track records? Now thanks to developer Second Dinner's internal data, fans have a definitive answer when it comes to the card that appears most frequently in losing decks, as well as the card that doesn't often appear in decks, but when it does, has the highest win-rate.</p><p dir="ltr">As revealed by <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-snap-best-worst-cards-deck-shang-chi-human-torch-1849978922?utm_campaign=Kotaku&amp;utm_content=1673537665&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_source=twitter">Kotaku</a> in an interview with Second Dinner founder Ben Brode, the developer's data shows that Shang-Chi is the card that appears most often in losing games. That might be surprising, as on the surface Shang-Chi seems powerful. Its ability automatically destroys an opponent's cards with 9 or more power at the same location, allowing Shang-Chi to effectively turn the tide of battle in one lane single-handedly. However, Shang-Chi is often a late-game card, and if it isn't played in a location where its special ability can be put to good effect, it's mostly wasted space.</p><p dir="ltr">On the other side of the equation is the card that Second Dinner's data reveals is the most "underrated," in that it isn't often seen in decks but when it does appear, has the best win-rate. That honor goes to the Human Torch, a 1-cost, 2-power card that has its power doubled every time it moves, making it perfect for move decks. The second most underrated card is another move-deck staple, Multiple Man, who makes a copy of itself every time it moves. Maybe people just don't like to use move-focused decks? A question for another time.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-marvel-snap-card-with-the-worst-win-rate-might-surprise-you/1100-6510521/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The video shows off the JFO-armor that you can earn from participating. This armor was introduced in Halo: Reach, like much of the cosmetics in the Winter Update and from the game's launch. In particular, the video showcases the Bay Sunset visor, the JFO helmet, the UA/Type JFO kneepads, and the SAP/JFO shoulder-pads. The video's caption on Twitter suggests that these items are only a few of the additions that the event will unlock.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Sneak into Covert One Flag and unlock JFO-class armor.<br /><br />Get it as part of the Joint Fire Event on Jan. 17. 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/fvetPLYnwy">pic.twitter.com/fvetPLYnwy</a></p>  &mdash; Halo (@Halo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Halo/status/1613306677108899842?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">January 11, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Covert One Flag was announced as one of new additions in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-winter-update-brings-campaign-co-op-and-forge/1100-6508415/">Halo Infinite's Winter season</a>.

Some players who have downloaded the latest patch are unable to get past the start menu, as it reliably crashes with no apparent workaround for affected players.</p><p>Server maintenance and an accompanying game patch were announced late in the evening of January 11 and applied overnight in US time zones. We can infer that not all players have been hit with this issue as there is, at the time of writing, one person streaming the game on Twitch. However, many in the comments of that stream are questioning how the player is able to access the game right now, so it seems like this current issue is affecting many players. In a tweet, the team said it's aware of the issue.

## Ubisoft "Surprised" By Lackluster Sales Of Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope

<p dir="ltr">Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope received <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/mario-+-rabbids-sparks-of-hope">positive reviews</a> from players and critics alike, but that apparently didn't translate to success on the charts. In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-projects-skull-and-bones-delayed-yet-again/1100-6510481/">recent statement</a> expressing disappointing holiday results, Ubisoft specifically called out Sparks of Hope and Just Dance 2023 as two titles that did not meet expected sales targets.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that the Mario + Rabbids sequel was rated one of the best Switch games of 2022, this lack of success is indeed surprising. However, the game did come out just before heavy hitters like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and God of War: Ragnarok, so it's likely that that had an impact.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of that announcement, Ubisoft said that it has canceled three unannounced games as part of an industry-wide shift towards "mega-brands and long-lasting titles." CEO Yves Guillemot explained that this trend is due in part to a contraction in overall consumer spending, which left customers with less money to spend on "other launches." He also said that the game has gotten excellent ratings from the community, and that Ubisoft expects the game to do good numbers over time.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-surprised-by-lackluster-sales-of-mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope/1100-6510517/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>In recent times, veteran filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese have criticized Marvel movies and how big blockbusters of the Marvel ilk are impacting the movie theater business. Kumail Nanjiani, who made his MCU debut in Eternals, said in a new interview that he doesn't understand why people got so upset about Scorsese's comments. After all, as Nanjiani sees it, Scorsese has earned the right so say whatever he wants about the state of film.</p><p>"I obviously love the movies Tarantino makes or Scorsese makes, and I may disagree with Scorsese's opinion on superhero movies, but I mean, who else has earned the right to have an opinion?" <a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/tv/a42430017/kumail-nanjiani-interview-chippendales/">he told Esequire</a>. "If Scorsese hasn't earned the right to have an opinion on movies, then none of us should have an opinion on movies. It's so strange that people get upset about it."</p><p>Scorsese made waves when he said Marvel movies are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-movies-are-a-new-art-form-martin-scorsese-s/1100-6470945/">"not cinema."</a> He later clarified that Marvel movies are made by people of "considerable talent and artistry" but he doesn't watch or enjoy Marvel movies because they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/martin-scorsese-clarifies-his-controversial-commen/1100-6471194/">do not personally appeal to his "taste and temperament."</a></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kumail-nanjiani-doesnt-understand-why-people-got-so-mad-about-scorseses-mcu-comments/1100-6510512/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Ubisoft's long-in-development pirate game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skull-and-bones/">Skull &amp; Bones</a> has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-projects-skull-and-bones-delayed-yet-again/1100-6510481/">delayed once again</a>, but not because the team needs more time to finish the base game. A spokesperson for Ubisoft told <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">Kotaku</a> that the swashbuckling adventure game is finished--the remaining development time will be used to "polish and balance" the game and implement changes based on feedback from technical tests. Additionally, it's been reported that Ubisoft has put together a special team at the company's headquarters in France to help get the game out the door.</p><p>"While Skull &amp; Bones is now complete, we are using the remaining time until our launch to leverage feedback from our ongoing technical tests and upcoming open beta to polish and balance the experience," a spokesperson said.</p><p>Kotaku reported that Ubisoft has put together a "strike team" inside its Paris studio to "get the game over the finish line."

<p>For the Resident Evil fan who has ever pondered the taste of the game franchise's unique herbs, prepare for some good and possibly <em>tasty </em>news. Capcom has teamed up with GameFlavor to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Resident Evil franchise by launching a box filled with collectible drink cans. There'll be 10 of these drinks available in the collector's box, as well as a few other extras.</p><p>GameFlavor says that the cans are inspired by the first-aid sprays and herbs of Resident Evil, and each can contains 330ml of cucumber and lime-mint flavored liquid. Tastes may definitely vary here. You can also find one spray cap inspired by the first Resident Evil game, four ink ribbons containing different Resident Evil-inspired herbs, four recipe cards for non-alcoholic Resident Evil-based cocktails, a certificate of authenticity, and an artbook.</p><figure style="width: 2048px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4085820-resithirstaid_0004%282%29.jpg"><img alt="Not to be applied to fresh zombie bite wounds." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4085820-resithirstaid_0004%282%29.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Not to be applied to fresh zombie bite wounds.</figcaption></figure><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4085821-resithirstaid_0004%283%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4085821-resithirstaid_0004%283%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4085822-resithirstaid_0004%284%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4085822-resithirstaid_0004%284%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4085823-resithirstaid_0004%285%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4085823-resithirstaid_0004%285%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4085824-resithirstaid_0005_layer1.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 4" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4085824-resithirstaid_0005_layer1.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p>This boxset will be limited to just 4,750 pieces and is available for the preorder price of $214 ahead of its scheduled launch in Q3 2023.

<p>The latest system update for PS5 consoles is out, and not only does it add the usual extra layer of stability to the system, but also support for Sony's high-tech DualSense Edge controller. Alongside the trademark the "this system software update improves system performance" message, the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps5/system-software/">brief patch notes</a> also reveal that "the DualSense Edge wireless controller is now supported" in PS5 update 22.02-06.50.00.</p><p>In case you missed it when it was first announced, the DualSense Edge is Sony's new premium controller that combines a high-quality design with a surprising amount of customization. This level of personalization is easy to play around with, and you can swap out the analog stick modules, stick caps, and more so that you can set up the device to suit your specific gaming needs.</p><p>It is a pricy extra to have for your PS5, as the DualSense Edge will cost you $200 when it releases on January 26. At least it includes a fetching white hardshell carrying case for that price.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ps5-update-adds-dualsense-edge-support/1100-6510504/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Some biomes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> have barriers blocking you from accessing certain areas within them. Clearing the way usually requires you to complete quests for certain characters--as is the case with the frustrating collection of mushroom batches standing between you and the other side of the Glade of Trust. We'll tell you how to clear a way across the bridges below.</p><h2>How to get rid of mushrooms in Disney Dreamlight Valley</h2><p>There are two types of mushroom batches found in the game--not including the tiny white mushrooms that can be picked and used in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-guide/1100-6507201/">cooking recipes</a>. There are the smaller batches that can be found scattered all over the valley, as well as the larger types, such as the ones blocking your way across the two bridges in the Glade of Trust. In order to clear these, <strong>you'll need to upgrade your watering can twice--once for smaller mushroom batches and then again for larger ones</strong>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Small mushroom batches will continue to spawn indefinitely around the valley, while the larger batches are finite and will not return after being cleared.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-how-to-get-rid-of-mushrooms/1100-6510439/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Disney Dreamlight Valley: Where To Get Hardwood

<p>Crafting in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> is a very resource-intensive task, so you're going to need lots and lots of every material you can get your hands on if you have the goal of crafting a wide variety of items for use in decorating your valley. One of the materials you'll need the most of is Hardwood, which can only be found in certain places in the game. Check below for where you can find Hardwood and why you'll want to stockpile it.</p><h2>Where to get Hardwood in Disney Dreamlight Valley</h2><p>Hardwood can be found laying on the ground near trees in the following biomes:</p><ul><li>Forest of Valor</li><li>Frosted Heights</li><li>Glade of Trust</li><li>Sunlit Plateau</li></ul><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4084696-disneydreamlightvalley_20230109151239.jpg"><img alt="Hardwood is darker than Softwood but lighter than Dark Wood." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4084696-disneydreamlightvalley_20230109151239.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Hardwood is darker than Softwood but lighter than Dark Wood.</figcaption></figure><p>Some biomes may have multiple types of these woods, so if you find that there's not much Hardwood around, you may need to pick up all of the other types to reset the spawns. Generally speaking, though, you should have no issue finding and collecting plenty of Hardwood by visiting each of the above biomes. And you're going to need it--a large selection of quests and crafting recipes ask for 25+ Hardwood each, after all. In other words, make sure you pick up any you see as you're doing other things, as it'll save you time in the long run.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-where-to-get-hardwood/1100-6510438/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
