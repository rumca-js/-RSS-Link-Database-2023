After facing widespread backlash from stove enthusiasts across the country, Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/12/biden-gas-stoves-republicans\" target=\"_blank\">ruled</a> the ban out as a possibility. </p><p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul, however, can't seem to take a hint. During her State of the State address, Hochul announced bans on gas stoves, as well as oil furnaces and hot water heaters in commercial construction and new homes. The bans are part of \"The New York Housing Compact,\" which is supposed to build 800,000 new homes over the next ten years to address New York State's historic housing shortage. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cKathy Hochul moves to ban gas stoves in New York\\n\\nhttps://t.co/876CCyKpNw\\u201d</div> \u2014 The Post Millennial (@The Post Millennial)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1613609301154697217\">1673549411</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the same state that just faced a historic blizzard in <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/buffalos-deadly-blizzard-numbers-made-storm-historic/story?id=95945684\" target=\"_blank\">Buffalo</a> which left some residents without power, food, or heat for days on end. Do you know what's really handy to have during a blizzard that causes power outages and closes all supermarkets? <em>A gas stove. </em><span></span></p><p>Not to mention, a gas stove ban would have a detrimental impact on restaurants. Restauranteur Stratis Morfogen told Tucker Carlson a ban on gas stoves would drop productivity by 40%, increase bills sixfold, and overall destroy the restaurant industry.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cThank you @TuckerCarlson  @FoxNews  for giving small business a BIG PLATFORM to fight GOVT over reach.  https://t.co/WsMHcZD0t5\\u201d</div> \u2014 Stratis Morfogen (@Stratis Morfogen)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stratism/status/1613019763361423360\">1673408854</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, Kathy Hochul infringing on the rights of her citizens is nothing new, which is a huge reason why so many New Yorkers have fled to Florida.

After all, if we shouldn\u2019t care about Ukraine, why should we station troops in Germany, Korea, or Japan? Why should we provide aid to African and Middle Eastern nations? Of course, each of these particular circumstances varies drastically from one to the next, and I\u2019m oversimplifying for effect. However, to the isolationist, the principle remains unchanged across the board. Why should America bother with the defense and economic support of foreign countries when we have more than enough problems to deal with domestically? Especially when our involvement abroad does nothing but cause mayhem and dissent.</p><p>Ironically, a major victory for these isolationists was in 2021 when Joe Biden abruptly pulled the United States out of Afghanistan. While many in that camp would have to concede the pullout was handled miserably, to them it was a necessity to remove America from what they call \u2018forever wars.\u201d Never mind the fact that at the time of the pullout, a mere 3,500 troops remained in the country, and that this small force was keeping the country stable. The idea of American involvement to any degree couldn\u2019t be tolerated.</p><p>It's here we should address the naivete of isolationism as a worldview. Those that support the idea must also necessarily believe that American foreign policy exists in a vacuum or that American interests are so separate from those of the outside world that foreign events have no bearing on life in the United States. </p><p>This couldn\u2019t be further from reality, as events in Afghanistan over the last year have shown. </p><p>Since the abrupt exit of American troops, Afghanistan has devolved at a rapid pace. On August 16, 2021, before the pullout was even complete, the Taliban took over as the official government of the country. Since then, they have instituted numerous draconian measures upon the Afghan people. A bulk of these are aimed at restricting women\u2019s rights, including a formal suspension of education for women.</p><p>As gross of a fiasco as this is, it admittedly does little to harm America outside of its reputation as a champion of human rights. But it\u2019s not the Taliban's draconian treatment of women that should most concern Washington. What should, however, is who the Taliban is making deals with.</p><p>Earlier this month, in its first energy extraction deal since coming to power, the Taliban signed an agreement with China's Xinjiang Central Asia Petroleum and Gas Company. The deal is a 25-year lease that allows the company to drill for oil in Afghanistan\u2019s Amu Darya basin. Chinese state companies are also looking at investments in Afghanistan\u2019s Mes Aynak copper Mines.</p><p>Furthermore, Afghanistan sits on roughly $1T worth of natural gas, copper, and rare earths, which Beijing is all too likely to exploit.</p><p>By haphazardly pulling out of Afghanistan the Biden administration essentially gifted China, America\u2019s biggest geopolitical threat, an untapped treasure trove of resources and a strategic foothold in Central Asia. Lack of action by Washington in South America and Africa has also allowed Beijing to make strategic gains through investment and military cooperation. </p><p>China is now the largest trading partner of both South America and Africa, and in 2017 China established its first overseas base in Djibouti, with further plans for a naval base in Equatorial Guinea in the works. </p><p>These developments are certainly concerning to Washington considering China\u2019s stated goal of challenging American supremacy globally. </p><p>The counterargument to isolationism is not that the US should indiscriminately involve itself abroad. In fact, both cases touched upon so far, Ukraine and Afghanistan, require nuanced debate as to the cost/benefit analysis of American intervention. There\u2019s certainly an argument to be made that prolonged commitment to Ukraine will strain our resources and ability to handle more pressing issues, like China. </p><p>It is true that there are areas that are of more strategic concern to the United States, namely: Northeast Asia, Europe, and the Persian Gulf. To ensure we can credibly defend our interests in these regions, trade-offs will have to be made. American foreign policymakers are often too weak-stomached to address this reality.</p><p>However, there is little nuance or strategy to isolationism\u2019s prescription. Should American politicians like Ted Cruz face tough questioning about the commitment of American soldiers and tax dollars abroad? Absolutely. But throwing around epithets like \u2018warmonger\u2019 and \u2018neo-con\u2019 at those who think that there are merits to American involvement in foreign causes is ignorant at best, and malicious at worst.</p><p>While it would be illogical to argue that American isolationism in the pre-WW2 era, led by figures like Charles Lindbergh, was directly responsible for the war itself, it would be equally illogical to say that it had no effect on the scale the war was allowed to reach. And while isolationism wasn\u2019t the ultimate cause of Pearl Harbor, the Japanese attack cemented how untenable isolationism is.</p><p>America was and remains the world\u2019s most powerful country, and because of this, its citizens have been granted untold privilege, both economically and politically. This status though is not God-given but earned.

The sexologist behind the term, Ray Blanchard, said that the majority of men who medically transition to females fall into this category. </p><p>Bauer said the issue with this theory is it would assume all trans-lesbians are fetishists, which is not the case. All this LGBTQAEIPP-2S mumbo jumbo can get confusing, so a quick clarification: by \"trans lesbian,\" she means a biological man who is attracted to a biological woman. Carry on. </p><p>If there were ever an example of a man who appears to get off on dressing like a woman, it would be Kayla Lemieux. There's just no other reasonable explanation to willingly subject yourself to boobs that large with such problematically protruding nipples. But when Bauer was specifically asked about Lemieux, she simply said he is a woman and should have access to all female spaces, as per the law. </p><p>A theory has been floated that Lemieux actually hates woke culture and is donning the ginormous knockers as a form of protest. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cIs the Canadian giant boobs teacher a fetishist - or actually trolling?

He pulled a gun and said, \"this is a stick-up.\" Three different customers pulled THEIR guns and said \"the f*ck it is!\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e3251\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32813975&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/armed-customers-stop-husband-wife-trying-rob-georgia-gas-station-gunpoint-police-say/KNFKNWSGCJAS3LU3OIJLFESSIU/?fbclid=IwAR367Og6BqK7z68XYLkDKk-JiNOj06AenPpT-D1SdoHsRziyr3v1D_3Mj9A\" target=\"_blank\">WSB-TV reports</a> when police arrived on the scene, Sutton refused to comply.

It was there to send a message. Walk in. F*ck shit up. Leave. That's literally what the dear did. It wrecked something off-camera. Then it left the way it came.

It's the shop's fault for not anticipating a ruminant mammal would come crashing through the front door and leave a safety mat out for it.</p><p>The butcher shop was closed temporarily for repairs. If you see Kramer, I'm not sure what the local hunting rules are but if you happen to have a bow and arrow handy, the She Said Butcher Shop might work out a deal with you.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
