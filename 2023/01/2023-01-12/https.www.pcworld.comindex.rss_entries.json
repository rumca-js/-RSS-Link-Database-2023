Instead of relying on commercial server farms, U.S.-based IPVanish prides itself on running its own hardware and servers. They even claim that running their own server infrastructure makes them a &ldquo;top-tier VPN service.&rdquo; In our test, we took IPVanish for a spin to see if it can truly live up to that self-proclaimed title.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: This review is part of our ongoing roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html\">best VPN services</a>.

The initial screen you&rsquo;re presented with is a quick connect dashboard with a world map that allows you to choose your server location and jump right in. At the bottom of the dashboard you can see basic information about your connection including the server location, IP address, connection status, protocol used, and data up and down. While it may not have any fancy design flair, the interface is intuitive and extremely user friendly. I did note however that the application itself seemed to lag or take an unusual amount of time to load things, such as when you move or zoom in on the map. First time connections to servers I had never used before also seemed to take longer than usual to connect.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"IPVanish\" class=\"wp-image-1444293\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Locations-Tab.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1018\" /><figcaption><p>IPVanish location tab with detailed server info.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Sam Singleton</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a toolbar on the left of the application&rsquo;s interface with options for <em>Locations</em>, <em>Settings</em>,<em> Info</em>, and <em>Account</em>. Under the <em>Locations</em> tab, you&rsquo;re able to access more detailed information about each server including each location&rsquo;s ping, load (amount of server utilization from current user connections), and number of servers available in that location. They also have a helpful filtering mechanism that allows you to find the servers with the least ping or load. There are over 2,000 servers all over the world to choose from on IPVanish, which is a huge step up from just a few years ago when they had less than half of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, IPVanish has made great strides in recent years to update and optimize its services. It now supports most major operating systems including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Chrome, Linux, and a few others. This is on par with most of the other top VPN providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IPVanish currently does not have a browser extension, but it does offer access to an in-browser SOCKS5 Proxy, which isn&rsquo;t encrypted like a VPN connection, but does allow you to still reroute your browser&rsquo;s traffic through remote servers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IPVanish has also improved recently in its location-spoofing abilities. In previous years, we noticed that IPVanish servers were frequently blocked when trying to access location-restricted content in other countries. The company has evidently stepped up its game and during the review period there were very few noticeable blockages while trying to access Netflix from a variety of IPVanish servers throughout the world. Take this with a grain of salt, however, as Netflix and other streaming services are constantly trying to block known VPN IP addresses, making it a cat-and-mouse game that could change another user&rsquo;s own personal experience.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"IPVanish\" class=\"wp-image-1444296\" height=\"679\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IPVanish-Support-Center.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1013\" /><figcaption><p>IPVanish 24/7 Customer support in Windows app.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Sam Singleton</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The company also does a great job with its customer support. It has a built-in support contact link directly from the app. Additionally, it offers 24/7 live chat support and a call center that is open every day of the week. Its app even supports multiple languages such as English, Spanish, French, German, and Dutch. These are all welcomed additions in recent years that show the company is trying hard to improve the full scope of its services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ipvanish-performance\">IPVanish: Performance</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"IPVanish\" class=\"wp-image-1444298\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ipvanishgraphic-100739054-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"428\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IPVanish</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With claims of having a superior network, how does IPVanish hold up in speed tests? Really well, actually. Comparing speeds across five different countries&rsquo; VPN server connections, IPVanish scored an impressive average of 59 percent of the base download speed and 54 percent of the base upload speed. That puts it firmly in the top five speediest VPNs we&rsquo;ve tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those relatively high speeds should be plenty fast enough to stream all of the high-resolution video or games across most country connections. Please note however that this is a single experience on a limited number of machines, and your experience may vary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ipvanish-security-and-privacy\">IPVanish: Security and privacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being based in the U.S. like IPVanish could potentially lead to privacy problems. This is due to certain domestic laws requiring that VPN companies log and store client information in the event that they&rsquo;re needed by law enforcement. But IPVanish promises to keep your data totally secure by not logging or sharing client information at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been validated recently when IPVanish allowed a third-party audit of its services which was conducted by Leviathan Security group. The audit confirmed the claims that IPVanish does not keep logs of client data whatsoever. It&rsquo;s not everyday that a VPN provider is willing to put themselves through that kind of scrutiny to substantiate its claims.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"IPVanish\" class=\"wp-image-1444297\" height=\"539\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IPVanish-Protocols.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1015\" /><figcaption><p>IPVanish has a number of Active Protocols to choose from so you can customize your connections.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Sam Singleton</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>IPVanish also supports a number of protocols such as WireGuard, IKEv2, and OpenVPN. It offers the additional option to customize OpenVPN connections, allowing you to further tweak and optimize your connection setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While using its service, everything is encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption which, while excellent, is the standard for most VPN providers nowadays. The Windows client comes with IPv6 and DNS leak protection&mdash;which our tests verified to be true using both DNS leak test and IPleak.net across all connections. Meaning that your true location is not being accidentally leaked while connected to its servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IPVanish VPN service comes with a few extra perks as well. It provides an automatic kill switch which will disconnect you from the internet in the event that your VPN connection is severed. Also, the VPN comes with an antivirus program called VIPRE. It&rsquo;s your standard run-of-the-mill antivirus but it&rsquo;ll still block malware and other threats on your computer&mdash;unfortunately it isn&rsquo;t available for mobile versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ipvanish-final-thoughts\">IPVanish: Final thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IPVanish is a very appealing VPN based in the United States. Its connection speeds have jumped by leaps and bounds since our last review and it&rsquo;s now firmly entrenched among our fastest VPNs. The desktop app has also been improved with an interface redesign that is easier to navigate. A recent third-party security audit is a refreshing sign that IPVanish is confident in its services and willing to prove it to users. At just a little under $50 for a yearly subscription the price is also hard to beat. Many people might gravitate to more prominent VPN providers, but IPVanish shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked. Its recent improvements show a willingness to add features that users want while continually improving year by year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Editor&rsquo;s note</em></strong><em>: Because online services are often iterative, gaining new features and performance improvements over time, this review is subject to change in order to accurately reflect the current state of the service.

The way you would stumble onto the site? Clicking on the first search result in Google for &ldquo;amd driver.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The link of course was not one picked by Google&rsquo;s normal search engine algorithm. It was instead an advertisement sitting in the very first search result slot&mdash;but labeled so discreetly that an otherwise conscientious new Radeon owner could be duped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These text-based advertisements aren&rsquo;t a new feature to Google, but their extremely discreet label and styling allow even old internet hands to click when distracted or in a hurry. They don&rsquo;t appear consistently either, adding difficulty in remembering when to avoid the very first result for a search. This scummy tactic is also not a new development in the world of malware. Hackers and scammers have always tried to use text-based ads to get hooks into our PCs and private data.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"A fake AMD driver site on Microsoft Bing\" class=\"wp-image-1471181\" height=\"552\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bingad.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Google&rsquo;s not the only search engine guilty of these shenanigans.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But though Google has long had the opportunity to better protect its users, the company has continually left consumers to dodge hazards on their own. Reporting malicious ads is the only way to try to scrub them from search results&mdash;and there&rsquo;s always more to take their place. It&rsquo;s not the only search engine that does this, either. In fact, while we couldn&rsquo;t replicate this particular issue in Google (possibly because the good citizens of Reddit reported that ad into oblivion), we did in Bing at the time this article was written. Thanks, Microsoft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, we&rsquo;ll be stuck with this issue for years to come, if the past is any indication. So don&rsquo;t allow yourself to grow lax, even as web browsers and antivirus software improve their security screening. You can take these three steps to guard yourself:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Always check the address of the link you&rsquo;re clicking.</strong> It&rsquo;s the best way to verify you&rsquo;re going to an official site. If you can&rsquo;t see the full URL, hover your mouse over the text link and it&rsquo;ll appear at the very bottom left of your browser tab.</li><li><strong>Scroll down the list of results.</strong> Text ads for legit companies will appear again as normal search results, often within the top five.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t click on results labeled as ads</strong>. Can&rsquo;t fall for malicious fake ads if you don&rsquo;t click on any ad links!</li><li><strong>Report malicious links as you see them.</strong> Notifying Google of problematic links makes search results safer for everyone on the web. Complain to Google about it, too. Just because the company outsources their screening to us doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to put up it silently.</li></ol>\n\nInternet, Security</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1471356/save-320-on-this-drop-dead-gorgeous-curved-acer-gaming-monitor.html", "title": "Save $320 on this crazy fast 240Hz curved Acer gaming monitor", "date_published": "2023-01-12 15:07:19+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re after the ultimate PC gaming experience, listen up.

Let&rsquo;s dive into the details then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Nitro XZ3 has a resolution of 2560&times;1440, a refresh rate of 240Hz, a response time of 1ms, and a curvature of 1000R. You can expect smooth visuals as well as a luscious picture. It&rsquo;s a phenomenal monitor for FPS gaming where every second matters. It has AMD FreeSync, which reduces the likelihood of screen tearing. For connectivity options, you&rsquo;re getting one DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0. You can also tilt, swivel, or vertically adjust the position of the monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a killer deal.

You pay a premium for the barrier-breaking privilege; the chip will cost $699 when it goes on sale today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 24-core Core i9-113900KS is essentially a special edition version of the already released (and unapologetically fast) <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html\">Core i9-13900K</a>. It features eight performance cores and 16 efficiency cores. The original Core i9-13900K could reach 5.8GHz on single-core loads, while the Core i9-13900KS will round that up to a smooth 6.0GHz on single-core loads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Core i9-13900KS continues our 13th Gen Intel Core desktop processor family excellence, showcasing the new performance heights made possible by our performance hybrid architecture,&rdquo; Intel Client Computing Group manager Marcus Kennedy said in a statement. &ldquo;Extreme gamers and enthusiasts can now push their everyday performance further than ever before with the first desktop processor in the PC industry to provide 6.0GHz speeds at stock.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how much does a 200MHz boost in turbo speeds buy you in performance? On the face of it, the new Core i9-13900KS might outpace the now plain-Jane 13900K by about 4 percent in some tasks. It&rsquo;s also possible the new KS chip might offer a small advantage elsewhere, too. Companies typically sort CPUs based on quality, a process called &ldquo;binning&rdquo; that usually means the the top binned chips are the cream of the crop, which brings other qualities besides the best stock speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Intel, however, it gives the company something to crow about over the competition. Humans oddly care a lot about the big round numbers&mdash;it&rsquo;s even said that 6GHz is more eye catching than, say, 6.2GHz to the average person. In other words, it&rsquo;s really all psychological, but also a point of pride to both companies who have been engaged in a slug fest for years over desktop processor performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Core i9-13900KS will likely go toe-to-toe with AMD&rsquo;s new <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444835/amd-launches-fastest-gaming-processors-with-even-more-v-cache.html\">Ryzen 9 7950X3D chip</a>, which was announced at CES.

The Acer Swift Edge lets you have your display and travel weight, too, supplying a roomy and modern 16-inch 16:10 wrapped in a thin, magnesium alloy chassis that&rsquo;s a mere half and inch thick and roughly two and a half pounds. We&rsquo;ve not seen a laptop with a larger screen that weighs less. Although I&rsquo;d happily accept an extra ounce or two of carrying weight for a more rigid lid for the display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E179\">The 16-inch display&mdash;an OLED panel with a crisp, 4K resolution&mdash;is outstanding and worth protecting. The image quality is stellar, offering brilliant color and outstanding contrast with inky blacks and bright whites. An octa-core AMD Ryzen 7 6800U CPU and integrated Radeon graphics power the action, a duo that offers some multimedia editing ability but better suited for general home entertainment and office pursuits. If you want the biggest OLED display in the thinnest, lightest design, the Acer Swift Edge is it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Looking for more thin and light laptops?

It looks like an extra-thin X1 Carbon. The lid is plain black and the keyboard and keyboard deck on the inside are also black with a simple Acer logo on the top edge of the lid and another centered on the bottom bezel below the display. A small, subtle Swift logo sits below the keyboard on the right side of the wrist rest. The Swift Edge looks like a corporate workhorse laptop, but one that&rsquo;s incredibly thin.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift Edge lid\" class=\"wp-image-1468762\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Acer-Swift-Edge-lid.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E239\">The laptop is a hair thicker than half an inch and weighs a scant more than 2.5 pounds. That&rsquo;s just not a weight we have even seen for a 16-inch laptop&mdash;not even close. At 3.86 pounds, the Acer Swift 3 is more than a pound heavier. Even the impressively thin and smaller 14-inch Lenovo Slim 9i weighs more at an even 3.0 pounds. The Swift Edge is able to achieve such a thin design and light weight because it&rsquo;s made not from aluminum like most laptops but a magnesium alloy that Acer states is 20% lighter and twice as strong as aluminum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E245\">Even with the reported double strength, the Swift Edge&rsquo;s magnesium alloy chassis doesn&rsquo;t have the most rugged and rigid feel. There is some flex on the keyboard deck, and the lid lets the display flex to an almost worrisome degree. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a thicker aluminum lid for added protection, even if it meant the Swift Edge would be a bit thicker and a few ounces heavier. Even with a more substantial lid, the Swift Edge would likely still weigh less than three pounds and remain eminently portable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E245\">The ThinkPad vibes begin to dissipate after you start typing on the Swift Edge. The keys are flat and offer very shallow travel&mdash;not surprising given the thinnest of the machine. They feel more like Apple&rsquo;s derided butterfly keyboard. If you are a fast touch typist, you&rsquo;ll probably enjoy the fast feedback, but others may bemoan the lack of a more traditional feel with deeper travel and a snappier response. The keyboard offers two-level backlighting, which you can conveniently control from the F11 key. The power button sits in the upper-right corner of the keyboard and doubles as a fingerprint reader for easy, secure logins.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift Edge keyboard\" class=\"wp-image-1468764\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Acer-Swift-Edge-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E254\">The touchpad is roomy and responsive with a comfortable click response that offers just the right amount of travel. The matte finish allows for smooth glide, and it accurately recorded my pinches and swipes and other mouse gestures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-swift-edge-display-and-ports\">Acer Swift Edge: Display and ports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E260\">Other than the extreme thinness and incredible lightness of the chassis, the display is the star of the Swift Edge show. It&rsquo;s a roomy 16-inch OLED panel with a 16:10 aspect ratio and a fine 4K (3840&times;2400-pixel) resolution. The display is outstanding in every way: bright and crisp with incredible contrast and vivid, accurate color. The 4K resolution produces a spectacularly sharp picture with crisp text and edges. I measured the max brightness at an impressive 630 nits&mdash;this is a laptop capable of being used outside in direct sunlight. The OLED panel produces absolute black levels and bright whites&mdash;there is just no beating the contrast ratio of an OLED display.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift Edge display\" class=\"wp-image-1468766\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Acer-Swift-Edge-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E265\">With a tall 16:10 aspect ratio, the 16-inch display feels huge. It offers plenty of space to juggle multiple windows and a big screen for watching shows and movies. Taller than the traditional 16:9 widescreen laptop display, the Swift Edge&rsquo;s display requires less scrolling through long docs and web pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E268\">The webcam above the display is a modern 1080p camera that produces a crisp, well-balanced picture with accurate color and skin tones. I have no complaints about the webcam&rsquo;s performance, but I will register a grievance about the lack of a physical shutter or electronic kill switch to protect your privacy when the camera is not in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t let the dotted grill above the keyboard fool you: that wide stripe of dots is venting for the laptop&rsquo;s cooling system and not a speaker grill. The Swift Edge features two downward-firing speakers that produce average laptop audio. It suffices for YouTube videos but lacks the bass needed for music playback and effects and explosions in movies.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift Edge left ports\" class=\"wp-image-1468767\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Acer-Swift-Edge-left-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift Edge right ports\" class=\"wp-image-1468769\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Acer-Swift-Edge-right-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E279\"><br />The Swift Edge features a pair of USB-C ports and a pair of USB-A ports, so you won&rsquo;t need to carry around an adapter. The USB-A ports are split across the left and right edges, but the USB-C ports are both located on the left edge, which means you&rsquo;ll need to loop the power cord around to that side if you are seated with an outlet to your right. The USB-C ports do not support Thunderbolt 4 because of the AMD chipset. They are USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports with up to 10 Gbps transfer speeds compared with 40Gbps for Thunderbolt 4. The Swift Edge also has an HDMI 2.1 port, an appreciated inclusion that is often omitted on thin-and-light laptops. It does lack an Ethernet port, which means you&rsquo;ll need a dongle if you want to connect to a wired network.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-swift-edge-performance\">Acer Swift Edge: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E288\">The Swift Edge features the Ryzen 7 6800U, a CPU with eight cores and 16 processing threads. It&rsquo;s an efficient CPU with a TDP between 15 and 28 watts. The other core specs are a sufficient 16GB of RAM, integrated AMD Radeon 680M graphics, and a spacious 1TB SSD. We compared its performance to models featuring Intel Core i7 processors from Intel&rsquo;s current 12th generation as well as a laptop with a Ryzen 7 chip from AMD&rsquo;s previous Ryzen 5000 series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E296\">In general, the Swift Edge felt peppy when navigating Windows and multitasking with a handful of open apps, including Chrome with dozens of open tabs. While the overall performance felt fast, the cooling fans were often employed during multimedia editing and 3D graphics tasks, a result of the ultra-thin chassis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E301\">Our first benchmark is PCMark 10, which measures performance on everyday computing work including office productivity tasks, web browsing, and video chats. The Swift Edge got off to a hot start in labs testing, surpassing the 6,000 threshold and finishing second to the high-powered MSI Summit E-16 Flip that has the added advantage of dedicated RTX graphics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift Edge PCMark\" class=\"wp-image-1468772\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Acer-Swift-Edge-PCMark.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"905\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E307\">Our HandBrake benchmark tests how a laptop is able to handle crushing CPU loads over a lengthy period&mdash;in this case, transcoding a 30GB MKV file to a format suitable for Android tablets using HandBrake, the free video encoding utility. The Swift Edge slipped to third on HandBrake behind the two laptops with RTX graphics but was first among the systems with integrated graphics.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift Edge Handbrake\" class=\"wp-image-1468773\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Acer-Swift-Edge-HandBrake.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"905\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E313\">Next up is Cinebench, another CPU-intensive test but one that renders a complex 2D scene over a short period of time. The Swift Edge posted a positive result on Cinebench, but the Lenovo Slim Pro 9i took top honors among the laptops with integrated graphics.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift Edge Cinebench\" class=\"wp-image-1470051\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Acer-Swift-Edge-Cinebench.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"905\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E319\">Not surprisingly, the two RTX-based laptops finished first and second on our 3DMark benchmark, but the Swift Edge with its integrated Radeon 680M GPU has a clear advantage over the Intel Iris Xe machines as the Dell Inspiron 14 7000 with its previous-gen Radeon graphics.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift Edge 3DMark\" class=\"wp-image-1468775\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Acer-Swift-Edge-3DMark.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"902\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E325\">To test a laptop&rsquo;s battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 11&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app, with the laptop set to Airplane mode and earbuds plugged in. We set the screen brightness at a relatively bright 250 nits to 260 nits, which is a good brightness for watching a movie in an office with the lights on. We had hoped that with its efficient Ryzen 7 6000 U-series chip, the Swift Edge would run longer. A runtime of 10 hours will get you through most workdays, but the competing laptops here are able to run for hours longer. The Swift Edge&rsquo;s high-resolution 4K OLED display is the likely culprit for the merely average runtime. Powering all of those pixels is the greatest drain on battery resources. A lower-resolution display would allow it to run longer, and we&rsquo;ve also seen that OLED panels have a slight adverse effect on battery life.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Acer Swift Edge battery test\" class=\"wp-image-1468776\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Acer-Swift-Edge.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"905\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-swift-edge-conclusion\">Acer Swift Edge: Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E338\">Go ahead, find another 16-inch 16:10 laptop that&rsquo;s thinner than 0.55 inches and lighter than 2.59 pounds. We have yet to encounter such a machine. The Acer Swift Edge makes for an easy commuting companion with a screen that&rsquo;s large enough to work and multitask on all day. And better still, the display is a 4K OLED panel that delivers a gorgeous image. We&rsquo;d argue for a slightly thicker and heavier chassis if it meant the lid behind the display was a bit more substantial and the keyboard deck allowed for keys with deeper travel and snappier feedback. As currently constructed, however, the Acer Swift Edge offers an unmatched combination of screen size and portability.</p>\n\nLaptops</div>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1443810/work-from-home-tech-products-for-a-better-home-office.html", "title": "18 work-from-home tech products that will level up your office", "date_published": "2023-01-12 11:30:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Making the switch from the office to working from home has become the new normal, but some users might feel like their setup is not as well-appointed or productive as at the office.

A Thunderbolt dock will help you expand your laptop&rsquo;s capabilities and allow you to connect to a larger monitor and a full size keyboard. You&rsquo;ll increase your productivity and your body will thank you for the ergonomic upgrade.
