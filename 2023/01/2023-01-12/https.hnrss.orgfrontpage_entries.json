Then 6: a few minutes later my slack login was invalidated. My question is: is it legal for someone to post on Slack as me?<p>Note: I'm in the US, working as a contractor (W-2 to the contractor, who I assume has something like a 1099 with the primary employer). The employer is in Madison, Wisconsin. I am in Florida.

My issue is with the amount of extra work it places on developers, much of it the \"dumb\" kind of work which can eat up hours and doesn't deliver all that much value.<p>i) It's a framework, with all the usual framework downsides<p>For example, a new package you install can require a new TypesScript version. Once installed, you then may need to update your source code. This can place quite a high tax on the developer, where perhaps a 10 minute change becomes hours long.<p>ii) Libraries are badly documented<p>Most libraries do not document their types, or have no examples using TypeScript. Some worst offenders: Apollo, Protobufjs. The type definitions exported by these libraries can be large and complex, and the error messages emitted by TypeScript are so long and cryptic the result is often a drawn out process of trial and error along with trawling through source files.<p>iii) Error messages are hard to follow<p>Errors are long and don't provide enough detail. They will explain a type mismatch referencing many types you may not have ever seen, and are not documented anywhere. Except for simple errors, many of them are very hard to follow to a remedy.<p>iv) It requires yet more transpilation<p>Transpilation takes time, and always adds a burden to developers. I didn't mind so much with ES6 etc because eventually many functions were included in a broad set of browsers. There doesn't seem to be much progress including TypeScript in a browser, and feels like these complicated transpilation steps could be with us for a long time.<p>I could probably add more to this list, but my point is that I just can't see that TypeScript is worth all this time investment and making progress so slow sometimes. Are there others that come to this conclusion? I mainly see positive posts about TypeScript.<p>edit: I referred to TypeScript as a framework which it isn't. However it feels similar to me in that you are at the whim of TypeScript developers and how they decide to progress with the language.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Copies of our former agreements - Terms of Service and Privacy Policy - are available in case you wish to compare.\nWhat do I need to do?<p>You don\u2019t need to take any action to accept the new Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

If you were in my position, beside the obvious of relaxing, hobbies, etc, what would you do? I have considered trying to find a part time development role (it would be difficult though as I am effectively on-call for when those 2-6 hours are).

"date_published": "2023-01-12 07:51:56+00:00", "description": "<p>There are a couple of engineers on my current team that I can only describe as being a little too smart for their own good, and I'm struggling a bit with how to work with them. I've worked with this sort of engineer on previous teams as well, and they all share a few traits:<p>- They're brilliant, I mean very smart people (in an almost academic way?)<p>- They have a big appetite for adding complexity to systems<p>- They also have a big appetite for adding work to their own plates<p>- Their code has no consistent style<p>I work in embedded systems, so I'm generally writing C for resource-constrained systems. This sort of environment is rife with footguns, and I spend most of my time just trying to avoid those. A big part of that is keeping the things that my team controls as simple as possible, and while we are resource constrained, it's a balance. The tension comes when someone's more than happy to, for example, implement a complex caching scheme from scratch to save a few hundred bytes here, a handful of microwatts there. To me, adding that type of complexity for those sorts of performance improvements is missing the forest for the trees.<p>When an engineer like this proposes something that adds unnecessary complexity, it's usually hard to argue with. The proposed change typically does indeed make the system objectively better, and they're the one taking responsibility for doing the work and ensuring its correctness. But the overall system becomes a little more brittle, and a little harder to reason about, two things that are much more difficult to measure than memory and power.<p>Here's an example: an engineer on my current team recently proposed adding a significant feature to a module I wrote to make something dynamic that's currently statically defined at compile time. I pointed out that we could just change a couple entries in a static table to accomplish his goals, and we were able to avoid the extra work. What was notable, though, was his immediate willingness to write that feature. Maybe I'm lazy, but I'd sit there and think of half a dozen other ways to do it before settling on changing the module itself. But because he's smart enough to easily reason about a complicated solution, and he's willing to take on the extra work, he stopped there without weighing it against the larger system.<p>Have you worked with engineers like this? Do you have any thoughts on how to work with them in a productive and friendly way?<p>--<p>One more example if you feel like reading more:<p>In a past role, I got into a debate about code style with the smartest person I've ever worked with. It boiled down to me advocating for more whitespace in his code and him arguing that adding whitespace made the code harder to read. It took a bit, but eventually I came to understand that he is so good at reading code that he just wants it all laid out in front of him as densely as possible. He can effectively run it in his head, as long as he can see it.<p>That was baffling to me, I walked away thinking that I must be pretty bad at reading code. I use a very consistent style with long variable and function names, I keep my solutions as simple as I can, and I use whitespace generously to provide visual cues about the code's structure. All of this is to minimize the amount of brainpower I needed to understand my code, so I can put that energy toward thinking about the problem itself.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34350446\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34350446</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 18</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://kristall.random-projects.net/", "title": "Kristall \u2013 a browser without support for CSS/JS/WASM or graphical websites", "date_published": "2023-01-12 07:50:26+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://kristall.random-projects.net/\">https://kristall.random-projects.net/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34350436\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34350436</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/01/10/why-did-teenage-suicides-decline-during-americas-first-covid-19-lockdowns", "title": "Teenage suicide rates dropped during lockdown due to respite from bullying", "date_published": "2023-01-12 07:50:13+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/01/10/why-did-teenage-suicides-decline-during-americas-first-covid-19-lockdowns\">https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/01/10/why-did-teenage-suicides-decline-during-americas-first-covid-19-lockdowns</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34350433\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34350433</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2023/01/garbage-collector.html", "title": "Pictures of a Working Garbage Collector", "date_published": "2023-01-12 07:21:37+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2023/01/garbage-collector.html\">https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2023/01/garbage-collector.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34350260\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34350260</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34350149", "title": "Meticulous (YC S21) Is Hiring #3 Founding Engineer in London", "date_published": "2023-01-12 07:01:39+00:00", "description": "<p>Hey HN,<p>I'm Gabriel, founder of Meticulous.<p>Our mission is to make the world's code safe, performant and reliable. We're starting with a tool to catch visual regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"http://meticulous.ai/\">http://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values-ab2b90d3324447d58f0720481081c9a6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You\u2019ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with \u201cHN\u201d in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr

Physician", "date_published": "2023-01-12 01:45:00+00:00", "description": "<p>I am a Millennial primary care physician. I began training before COVID hit, so I have perspective as someone who practiced medicine before, during, and after the pandemic. There are multiple, long-standing issues in medicine, many that have been unmasked by COVID but have been festering for a long time:<p>Doctors don\u2019t run hospitals. Due to EMTALA, every single patient that shows up to your emergency department has to be treated. When insurance companies and private equity realized that you can\u2019t say no to doing the work, then why should they pay you? Ultra lean staffing prior to covid led to the sh*tshow during the pandemic and, now that everyone is quitting, things are now in total collapse.<p>Go to any hospital in the country and, even if you have a serious problem like a heart attack, sepsis, a kidney stone blocking off your ureter while your kidney fills up with pus and you\u2019re turning grey and shivering because you\u2019re dying, well, chances are you\u2019re going to be lying in a bed in the hallway.<p>Up in the ICU hopeless 95 year olds will sit on ventilators and other life support machines for weeks because doctors don\u2019t have any discretion in stopping futile care. You can be a 30 year old pregnant woman, and you will die waiting for your ICU bed in the emergency room. There are 30 rooms in the ER, but 3 nurses overnight\u2026what do you think happens if you have an accident and urinate or have a bowel movement in the bed? That\u2019s exactly what happens. Good luck getting pain medicine for your kidney stone, there\u2019s 10 other patients and they\u2019re all sicker than you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34347962\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34347962</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.theautopian.com/newly-released-video-of-thanksgiving-day-tesla-full-self-driving-crash-demonstrates-the-fundamental-problem-of-semi-automated-driving-systems/", "title": "New Video of Tesla Crash Demonstrates the Problem of Semi-Automated Driving", "date_published": "2023-01-12 01:19:40+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.theautopian.com/newly-released-video-of-thanksgiving-day-tesla-full-self-driving-crash-demonstrates-the-fundamental-problem-of-semi-automated-driving-systems/\">https://www.theautopian.com/newly-released-video-of-thanksgiving-day-tesla-full-self-driving-crash-demonstrates-the-fundamental-problem-of-semi-automated-driving-systems/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34347778\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34347778</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://qualtrics.gcs-web.com/static-files/ede48f82-dd50-4278-928e-8f58230a349d", "title": "Qualtrics announces 270 layoffs, 5% of company", "date_published": "2023-01-12 00:39:32+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://qualtrics.gcs-web.com/static-files/ede48f82-dd50-4278-928e-8f58230a349d\">https://qualtrics.gcs-web.com/static-files/ede48f82-dd50-4278-928e-8f58230a349d</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34347399\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34347399</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/11/the-energy-crisis-and-europes-astonishing-luck", "title": "The energy crisis and Europe\u2019s astonishing luck", "date_published": "2023-01-12 00:01:07+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/11/the-energy-crisis-and-europes-astonishing-luck\">https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/11/the-energy-crisis-and-europes-astonishing-luck</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34346951\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34346951</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Hacker News - frontpage"}}
