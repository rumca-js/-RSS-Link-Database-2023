<p>Tottenham have not really done first halves over the past few months. In 14 previous games in all competitions, they had scored only once before the interval. But what was this? Antonio Conte’s team were 2-0 up when the half-time whistle sounded. The Etihad Stadium was in a state of uproar, Manchester City’s players departing to jeers, Pep Guardiola looking as if he might combust.</p><p>City had needed a response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/14/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">their derby defeat</a> at Manchester United, and to a sequence of two wins in five Premier League matches that had allowed Arsenal to lengthen their stride at the top of the table. Now they really needed a response. Spurs’s goals had been scored at the end of the first half by Dejan Kulusevski and Emerson Royal. They could smell a repeat of their stunning victory here last season; a tonic after a dispiriting run.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/19/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Bagbeard has loads going for it: a Stranger Things-alike story that’s three parts ridiculous to one part tender-hearted, lovably knowing meta-theatrical trickery, and no opportunity missed to score a laugh, cheap or otherwise.</p><p>It’s impressive how much they cram in – and how dramatic a pitch the show attains as the hour reaches its end. Among a dozen-plus characters, our key protagonists are a sacked teacher nursing thwarted dreams of scientific discovery, a contract killer with a romantic streak, and an extra-terrestrial marooned on an isolated island. Bagbeard (“Heavy is the chin that wears the bag”) brings the trio together in a story that flashes forward and back, via all manner of daft staging devices (shadowplay, montage sequences, musical theatre), and navigates pagan festivals, an alien apocalypse and an evil genius drinking the life force of OAPs en route.</p><p>At <a href="https://sohotheatre.com/shows/crybabies-bagbeard/">Soho theatre, London</a>, until 21 January and then 7-11 March</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/19/crybabies-bagbeard-review-sci-fi-caper-boldly-goes-down-a-storm">Continue reading...</a>

## Alec Baldwin remains brooding, defiant enigma in Rust shooting’s aftermath

<p>Analysis: actor’s complex public persona remains intact as he faces charges in death of Halyna Hutchins</p><p>Whatever else has happened, or will happen, in the vividly eventful career of movie star Alec Baldwin, his name is destined to be linked with that of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, whom he tragically shot dead on a movie set in New Mexico in 2021. Baldwin accidentally fired a live bullet from a revolver being used as a prop. Now he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/19/rust-film-set-shooting-criminal-charges-alec-baldwin">faces criminal charges</a> of involuntary manslaughter, despite a private legal settlement Baldwin reportedly reached with the Hutchins family.<br /><br />Alec Baldwin’s mercurial, defiant, combatively emotional behaviour – which has been part of his presence as a performer and public figure – has been in evidence since the shooting. He gave an emotional interview last August in which he blamed the armourer and the props assistant but declined to blame himself and even exhibited notes of histrionic self-pity, talking about the acting jobs he had lost and thanked his wife, Hilaria: “If I didn’t have my wife, I don’t know where I would be right now …” Not a tactful thing to say, with Matt Hutchins mourning the loss of his wife.</p><p><br />Baldwin has no obvious desire to make a penitent retreat from the spotlight. Last month, he hosted the glitzy Ripple Of Hope ceremony in New York City, conferring the award on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for their activism on racial justice, pointedly praising their handling of “difficult circumstances in the press” and joking that he could be their “driver”. It was precisely the kind of celebrity-liberal nexus in which Baldwin is so bullishly at home.<br />Baldwin began his movie career as a hunky male lead in movies such as Working Girl (1988) and The Hunt For Red October (1990) but he morphed (and bulked out) into a complex, potent character actor – while often lamenting his failure to clinch Hollywood alpha status. It was a career pivot signalled by his unforgettable cameo as the bullying salesman in the movie version of David Mamet’s Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), snarling: “Always be closing.” In this new persona, he worked with directors like Woody Allen (of whom he has been a great defender) and Martin Scorsese, and got an Oscar nomination for his tremendous performance in Wayne Kramer’s enigmatic Vegas drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1241206,.html">The Cooler</a>.<br /><br />But his celebrity brand got a turbocharge from his almost incessant appearances in the gossip media for chaotic behaviour: he separated with maximum acrimony from his wife Kim Basinger, and in a furious voicemail directed at his preteen daughter, leaked to the press, he called her “a rude, thoughtless little pig”, in that unmistakable bass rasp. He hit a paparazzo, got thrown off a plane for refusing to put away his electronic device, responded with icy resentment when Hilaria’s claims to a Spanish background were mocked, and furiously attacked the Daily Mail for suggesting that she had been tweeting during James Gandolfini’s funeral.<br /><br />In effect, he became the real-life Mr Hyde to the likable – and brilliantly written and performed – Dr Jekyll persona created for him by Tina Fey in the TV comedy 30 Rock: Jack Donaghy, the cheerfully reactionary Republican television producer who has nothing but contempt for liberals. Baldwin also had a longstanding turn on Saturday Night Live playing Donald Trump.<br /><br />When I interviewed Baldwin, I saw for myself how this complicated, fraught, charming man was perpetually “on”: like many journalists who met him, I found that it was like talking to Jack Donaghy, how Baldwin loved making people laugh, or at least thrill to his serio-comic, wolfishly grinning presence. His comedy career was very important to him. Watch his appearance opposite Jerry Seinfeld on the web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, and you’ll see – despite all the laughs and kidding around – how wounded and sensitive he is, how desperate for super-celebrity status like Seinfeld’s. He is a brooding, saturnine presence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/19/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-involuntary-manslaughter-charges-analysis">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a big responsibility, he’ll play against Son, Kulusevski, Kane, but it’s the perfect choice tonight. We have some patterns of play that we need to reignite again. The solution is not to do something that we have not done in seven years, because we have won four Premier Leagues in five years. If I think we should do something different, I would be stupid, because it works! So you have to try to do it again. Sometimes you forget.

<p>Even as millions are sweating over self-assessment forms ahead of this month’s deadline, HMRC dishes up big dollops of bad news</p><p>Leona Helmsley’s greatest wrongdoing was ultimately not her vast tax fraud but to be overheard by her housekeeper declaring: “Only the little people pay taxes.” Rather than the millions she owed the state, the New York property billionaire’s belief that the tax system is merely a glorified tip jar, strictly for mugs, made her<a href="https://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1891335_1891333_1891317,00.html"> infamous in the Reagan years</a>. Of all the affairs of democratic government, only taxes and voting rest so firmly on the principle that all subjects are equal before the law. However unsatisfactory the idea that what GP services, schools, bin collections you get depend on where you live, ‘postcode lottery’ is now an everyday term – but taxation and representation should never be arbitrary.<br /><br />Which is why Rishi Sunak is sailing in dangerous waters. At this week’s prime minister questions <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jan/18/nurse-train-teachers-anti-strikes-bill-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-pmqs-uk-politics-live">he was tackled by Labour’s Alex Sobel</a> about the reports that the chairman of the Tory party, Nadhim Zahawi, was “forced to pay millions to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs [HMRC] to settle a tax dispute”. The prime minister responded that his colleague had “already addressed this matter in full”, but he was wrong. Mr Zahawi is an able communicator, yet on this he has been unforthcoming, not denying the reports about capital gains tax incurred by the sale of a £20m stake in YouGov by a family trust, only saying his taxes “are properly declared and paid in the UK”.</p><p>That sounds odd: someone who has fully declared their taxes does not reach a big settlement with HMRC. Ministerial colleagues have said, <a href="https://perspectivemag.co.uk/minister-defends-ex-chancellor-nadhim-zahawi-over-his-tax-affairs/">as Robert Jenrick did</a> this week, that it is a “private matter” and HMRC rightly does not comment on individuals’ tax affairs. Mr Zahawi is not being accused of criminal tax evasion. Yet the very notion that a chancellor of the exchequer – as Mr Zahawi was last summer, serving twice as long as the hapless Kwasi Kwarteng – should be setting the taxes of the country while striking a deal on his own tax affairs would seem an extraordinary conflict of interest. Mr Zahawi may have done nothing wrong, but the public deserves to know the truth. Without some accountability, the tax system will lose a little more legitimacy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-tax-system-losing-trust-missing-out-on-billions">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tour optimistically called PMConnect starts with visit to Morecambe, just given £50m grant</p><p>If at first you don’t succeed … For his first few months as prime minister, Rishi Sunak’s minders have tried to keep him away from the public as much as possible. The submarine commander. Leading us to victory from beneath the waves. Or not. Because it turns out that you can dislike what you don’t see. Rish!’s attempts to steady the economy and resolve the strikes have been met with at first scepticism and then incredulity. The man sold to us as a competent tech bro, the management consultant for all seasons, was yet another Tory dud. Not much better than Liz Truss or Boris Johnson.</p><p>So, just a few months in, it’s time for a relaunch. Sunak 2.0. Rish! is to be uncaged. To be let loose among his people. On a tour optimistically called PMConnect. Except the prime minister can barely connect with himself, let alone the rest of the country. So more like PMDisconnect. There’s a gaping void between him and the country. And how could there not be? The whole point of being part of the megarich is not having to engage with the little people. To immunise yourself from the day-to-day stresses of ordinary life. Rish! can no more suddenly decide he wants to spend time among us than we can share his cushioned lifestyle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/19/baby-steps-rishi-sunak-relaunch-soft-crowd-morecambe">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Murray battles back from two sets down in his longest match </li><li>4-6, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (5), 6-3, 7-5 win finishes at 4am in Melbourne</li></ul><p>As Thanasi Kokkinakis stepped up to the baseline with a two-set lead to serve out perhaps the best performance of his life, defeat would have come quickly for most other players across the net. But Andy Murray does not wallow in doubt when in trouble. He furiously scours for solutions, he fights with whatever he has and, throughout his career, he has so often found a way.</p><p>From the brink of defeat, the 35-year-old somehow pulled off one of the greatest feats of his exceptional career, recovering to win a second consecutive five-set match – with a metal hip. This time he triumphed 4-6, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (5), 6-3, 7-5 in a five-hour, 45-minute match that lasted until 4am. The victory marks Murray’s return to the third round of the Australian Open after six years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/19/andy-murray-australian-open-tennis-thanasi-kokkinakis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this likable spin on the genre, Lopez’s wedding to a sensitive baseball player runs aground when a boatful of armed men arrive</p><p>Against the odds, the expectations and the run of play, here is a romcom starring Jennifer Lopez and it’s … well, it’s pretty good: enjoyably goofy and sparkily written. Lopez plays Darcy, a woman who agrees to a giant wedding party on a luxury Philippine island holiday resort which her insecure fiance Tom has laid on for her. He’s a failing baseball star, defensive about being recently dropped from the team and likably played by Josh Duhamel. (Ryan Reynolds is one of the executive producers and may possibly have had his eye on the role.)</p><p>There are some nice gags here, and smart twists from screenwriter Mark Hammer, and some funny supporting turns. Jennifer Coolidge comes close to stealing the whole thing as Darcy’s eccentric future mother-in-law Carol, Darcy’s divorced parents Robert and Renata are played by stoner-comedy veteran Cheech Marin and the distinguished Brazilian star Sonia Braga (from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/23/aquarius-review-sonia-braga-filho">Kleber Mendonça Filho’s arthouse hit Aquarius</a>) who never treats this material with anything other than absolute seriousness. Above all there is Darcy’s creepy alpha male, hardbodied and sensitive overachiever ex-boyfriend Sean, amusingly played by Lenny Kravitz, who shows up unannounced at the wedding and ignites a firestorm of miserable jealousy in poor Tom’s heart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/19/shotgun-wedding-review-jennifer-lopez-romcom">Continue reading...</a>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2022/nov/14/football-daily-email-sign-up">Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!</a></p><p>Football Daily is the first to hold its hands up when we get things wrong, and this week our predictions have been signally less than stellar. So far we’ve put forward the theory that Jürgen Klopp will never smile again, suggested that Wolverhampton Wanderers were looking good for a first FA Cup since 1960, and tipped Manchester United for the title. That whopping three for zero was confirmed late on Wednesday night when Michael Olise <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/18/crystal-palace-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">whistled an astonishing free-kick</a> past David de Gea’s lugs before pointedly not bothering to celebrate, in the manner of a player who had just denied his previous club a couple of precious points and wanted to showcase some maximum respect. You can bet your last penny Wilfried Zaha won’t hold back like that if he ever scores a last-minute zinger against Reading.</p><p>Since clubs being in crisis is the favo(u)rite subject of Football Daily, you might want to look over the pond where all five official supporters groups of the LA Galaxy have come together to boycott all games until club president Chris Klein is shown a certain door marked with specific verbiage. We may even march from a tailgate we were already going to, to a match we had no intention of boycotting, in the grand tradition of Manchester United, Everton et al” – Tom Dowler.</p><p>Reading about Richard Brind’s hard week (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/18/football-daily-email-antonio-conte-tottenham">yesterday’s Football Daily letters</a>), demanding diagrams to go with your work, his plea has not gone unnoticed. Watching football on the TV, I see many managers resort to traditional ways (biros, scraps of paper, etc) in noting something or other, hoping to impart half-time flannel to thwart a defeat. Thus, I have begun an art project encapsulating their scribbled jottings. Titled ‘Managers’ Notebooks’ (not digital since that would be a Klopp-out), it is a collection of drawings and prints that attempt to represent the turmoils of watching self-inflicted escapism/optimism. I rely on the hopeless shrug of a Moyes or a Lampard, the panicky Conte <a href="https://www.montegrappa.com/">Montegrappa</a> or a Rodgers slap and others.

<p><strong>Ustinov Studio, Bath<br /></strong>The humour is a little too clownish in Lindsay Posner’s revival of Edward Albee’s classic but the toxic power games are potent</p><p>So much of Edward Albee’s 1962 play about a boozy marital meltdown relies on the explosive chemistry of its central, unhappy couple. Such is the almighty shadow cast by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in the 1966 film that it is hard to banish it altogether but also unfair to compare. Under the direction of Lindsay Posner, the dynamic between Elizabeth McGovern as the domineering, disappointed Martha and Dougray Scott as her jaded university professor husband, George, is refreshingly different. </p><p>They perform their parts much more overtly as a game, like huffy children role-playing tantrums. Their living-room showdown begins in this mode as George opens the door to Nick and Honey, the younger couple they have invited round, and Martha orders him to make their drinks. The humour is a little too clownish in these early scenes and the verbal salvoes and hostile laughter feel a little soft.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/19/whos-afraid-of-virginia-woolf-review-ustinov-studio-bath">Continue reading...</a>

I feel like everyone around me, and in the media, is obsessed with the power of female friendships at the moment. I’m getting married and I won’t have any bridesmaids, even though my partner will have a fleet of groomsmen.

It’s certainly a departure from English-speaking Hollywood, though perhaps a tribute to a very shrewd marketing campaign from a certain streaming service.

They are proud of this film. Rightly so. It is the first German-language adaptation of the book and is very good: excellently acted and staged, with severity and moral seriousness, though without any great original interpretative slant. Some might be surprised at quite how this film seemed to have leapfrogged everyone else. It could well be because we are now all so grimly aware of the unquiet eastern front; the brutal and continuing war in Ukraine may have directed Bafta’s collective unconscious to this brutal subject.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/19/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-netflix-baftas-nominations">Continue reading...</a>

To open the discussion, Thunberg told the audience it is 'absurd' that in Davos 'we are listening to the people who are mainly causing the climate crisis, rather than those on the frontline'.

He had to quit in his early 30s because he started suffering black outs. He had one in a lesson “and the kids all thought I was dead”.</p><p>So he sought specialist help. At first, the doctors told him he had motor neurone disease and that he ought to go home and start “making preparations”. After the next round of tests they decided it might be Multiple Sclerosis. He had four years of treatment before they realised it was another misdiagnosis. Finally, he found a neurologist who was able to tell him what was wrong. He has probable Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), probable because it can only be diagnosed definitively postmortem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/19/cte-rugby-chronic-traumatic-encephalopathy-legal-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The horror sequences are more vivid, the storytelling explores new worlds and it turns a familiar tale into something that grips you all over again. It’s the dream video game adaptation</p><p>When it comes to video-game adaptations, TV and film producers have historically had an unfortunate habit of using the game as a kind of Mad Libs prompt for something completely unrelated. Characters you’ve spent 30 hours getting to know in a game might remain in name and appearance only, given personality transplants to fit into new, incongruous plots. There has been an endemic lack of respect for video games from decades’ worth of film-makers who, in the words of games satire site Hard Drive News, have been excited to take a beloved franchise and adapt it into something <a href="https://hard-drive.net/filmmaker-honored-for-opportunity-to-take-beloved-video-game-franchise-and-adapt-it-into-something-not-for-dumb-little-babies/">not for dumb little babies</a>.</p><p>HBO’s The Last of Us finally marks the end of this era. There’s been a shift in the tenor of game adaptations in the past few years; you could tell that Detective Pikachu was written by huge Pokémon fans, Cyberpunk 2077’s Netflix series was actually better than the game, and the plot of Paramount’s TV version of the military space-opera Halo is just as ponderous and self-important as the games. But the close involvement of The Last of Us co-creator Neil Druckmann in the TV series takes HBO’s adaptation to another level. The Last of Us doesn’t just preserve the premise and characters of the game; it tells us something new about them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/19/the-last-of-us-video-game-tv-adaptation-triumph">Continue reading...</a>

## Måneskin: Rush! review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week

<p><strong>(Epic)<br /></strong>The Italian quartet prove themselves sharp operators with an infectiously enthusiastic record inspired by a grab-bag of influences</p><p>Has there been a more improbable pop phenomenon in recent years than the rise of Rome-based quartet Måneskin? Whatever your musical predictions for 2021 were, they definitely didn’t include an international breakthrough by the runners-up of the Italian X Factor. They were unexpectedly propelled to global stardom by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/22/eurovision-2021-maneskin-triumphs-for-italy-in-rotterdam">victory in the Eurovision song contest</a> and a viral surge in the popularity of their cover of the Four Seasons’ 1967 hit Beggin’. Måneskin’s version takes its cues not from the original, but a 21st-century version by Norwegian hip-hop duo Madcon. Initially, Måneskin’s success seemed to be the type that came with the inbuilt tang of short-lived novelty; instead things just seemed to escalate: a support slot on the Rolling Stones’ US tour; a collaboration with Iggy Pop; an appearance on the soundtrack of Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis biopic; more than 6.5bn streams. At the end of summer 2022, a point by which observers might reasonably have assumed Måneskin’s 15 minutes would long be over, they were instead in a position to sack-off an appearance at the Reading and Leeds festival because they had a better offer: an appearance at the MTV VMAs, at which they walked off with the best alternative video award.</p><p>Perhaps Måneskin are rather sharper operators than the unexpectedly-propelled-to-global-fame narrative implies. Listening to Rush!, their first album with lyrics primarily in English, you’re struck by how canny their sound is. Once purveyors of wan funk-rock in the vein of the Red Hot Chili Peppers – a sound that netted vast success in their homeland – they gave themselves an overhaul shortly before Eurovision, while temporarily residing in London: the only track on Rush! that resembles Flea and co is the lumbering La Fine, which is also the worst thing here. These days, the label that’s most frequently attached to them is glam, but that seems largely rooted in their penchant for flared catsuits and lyrical expressions of non-specific rebellion: “Honestly, I don’t give a fuck / I’m addicted to rock’n’roll, yeah,” frontman Damiano David barks on Kool Kids, a song that also offers the band’s disinclination to use dental floss as evidence of their wild-eyed outsider status. Certainly, the glam tag has almost nothing to do with the music: Read Your Diary features glam drums, but somehow feels like it has more in common with the 00s pop that also used that rhythm – Katy Perry’s I Kissed a Girl, Britney Spears’ Womanizer – than the oeuvre of Slade or Sweet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/19/maneskin-rush-review-eurovision-winners-extend-their-improbable-15-minutes-of-fame">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a lean decade, the 90s staple has returned in a big way. But there is one key difference: grey hair. How did older actors take over the genre?</p><p>Much like a platonic friend who realises that their soulmate was by their side all along, Hollywood has finally noticed how desperate we are for new romantic comedies.</p><p>Over the past decade, we were lucky if we got one high-profile romcom a year. But on 27 January, there are three to choose from. On Netflix, there is <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81194505">You People</a>, co-written by Jonah Hill, in which Hill’s Jewish character gets together with Lauren London’s black Muslim character (culture-clash hilarity ensues).

<p>I serve them up culinary delights, but when I’m not there it’s sausage sandwiches and jacket potatoes that they crave</p><p>To live in my house is to know gustatory joy. I wake each morning, thinking only of dinner. What shall I cook for them all today? What glorious dish shall I present to my lucky family tonight? Shall I head to the hot and numbing embrace of Sichuan or the darker flavours of northern Spain? Will salted anchovies be involved somewhere in the profound depths of a sauce with more power and oomph than a Porsche 911 Turbo? They often are. I have cupboards full of condiments and sauces. I am rich in ground cumin, dried chillies and sticky pots of tamarind. I have the kitchen skills, the determination and the monumental greed needed to execute brilliant food for every meal. Being part of my family is to win the culinary lottery of life.</p><p>Or perhaps not. Recently, as I was serving up my latest creation – it may have been the long-braised ox cheeks in a spiced tomato sauce from a recipe by José Pizarro, or perhaps the teriyaki chicken – I asked my loved ones what they’d had for dinner on a previous night when I’d been out. It was a casual question, with a far less than casual intent. I wanted to know just how much they’d missed me. My wife, Pat, sat up and grinned. “Sausage sandwiches,” she said. “It was great.” My boys joined in. Oh yeah, doughy, cheap white bread, and the crap sausages, not those annoying ones with too much actual meat in them, and nowhere near enough nipple and nostril. The three of them fell to discussing the thrills of their sausage sandwich fest. I blinked. Sausage sandwiches? For dinner? Pat shrugged, and dug around at the lovingly crafted plate of utter wonderfulness in front of her. “We have to wait for you to go out to be able to do that sort of thing.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/19/what-could-my-family-love-more-than-my-braised-ox-cheeks-plenty-jay-rayner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From sharing a cuppa to lazing in the park, is the key to happiness doing everyday activities with pals?</p><p>Some of my fondest memories of friends should, by rights, be entirely forgettable. There was that time we took our books to the park and dozed. The time we sat by the sea drinking coffee, watching the waves. The time we assembled my flatpack furniture (well – I watched), ordered a pizza and watched TV.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, these open-ended hangs were effortless and<strong> </strong>my social life flowed with only the lightest steer. Fast-forward to now, and – whether it’s the difference between being in my 30s versus my 20s, or 2023 versus 2013, or a pile-up of both – often the best I can manage is a quick drink after work in three weeks’ time. No one, myself included, is ever free to just hang out. “I’d love to,” I say, sincerely – but there is always a “but”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/19/you-have-to-set-time-aside-for-friendship-the-radical-power-of-hanging-out">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s full of reality TV stars, packed with mean competitiveness and has none of the charming sincerity of the UK version. Hopefully it’s not a warning sign for series two …</p><p>There are plenty of reasons to watch <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/16/the-traitors-us-review-pure-evil-shout-at-the-tv-brilliance">the US version of The Traitors</a>, now that the whole thing is on iPlayer. If you were one of the many viewers gripped by the UK Traitors’ blend of intrigue, betrayal and school sports day, then this is a decent substitute until the inevitable British second series arrives. It is fascinating to see how the same game – essentially, who is good at lying? – can be played in such a different way, depending on who’s involved.</p><p>Best of all, Alan Cumming hosts. I love Claudia Winkleman, but Cumming presents as if he is a supply teacher sent to look after an unruly classroom that he can’t be bothered to discipline. He adds accessories scene by scene. He can start an episode wearing a kilt and a blazer, and by the end have put on a shawl, a brooch, glasses and a beret. He archly quotes and misquotes Shakespeare. The man has come up with 300 different ways of pronouncing the word “dollars”. He is evidently having a ball.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/19/us-traitors-bbc-reality-show">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Will will the world’s most cutthroat plutocrats and cold-blooded status-seekers stop trying to convince us they have a heart of gold?</p><p>Has there ever been a “meeting that should have been an email” so glaring as Davos? Each year, the world’s masters of politics and finance ride carbon-spewing jets to the World Economic Forum in a lavish Swiss resort town bristling with armed guards, where they opine somberly about solving poverty and climate change. The very act of attendance exposes all the subsequent dialogue as hypocrisy. The event serves primarily as a rare point of unity for political right and left wings, both of whom agree that everyone there should be in jail. If all of these professional decision-makers were really good at decision-making, they would replace the whole farce with an annual quick chat. “So then, we’ll carry on with global capitalism for another year. Agree? Right. Cheerio.”</p><p>Davos and similar conclaves can only be understood as performances. They are the stage upon which the Masters of the Universe act out the dramatic narrative of their own lives. They are exercises in mutual self-affirmation: we’re here, and we are important. What good is a powerful position without a rapt audience to listen to one’s pronouncements? Anyone can be rich, but only a select few can be influencers.</p><p>Hamilton Nolan is a writer at In These Times</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/davos-masters-of-the-universe">Continue reading...</a>

Instead of winding down after training – perhaps by watching some Netflix, like her teammates – the Reading midfielder gets straight back to work on what she describes as her “online coaching universe”: that is her own company, <a href="https://troelsgaardfitness.dk/">Troelsgaard Fitness</a>, set up during the pandemic. On top of being a professional footballer, Troelsgaard is an online coach, providing tailored nutritional plans and exercise programmes to her clients, currently more than 30 people.</p><p>“All my teammates just always say: ‘How can you just go home and then still work?’ Because after training my team are just going home, and then relax,” she says over Zoom. “But I’m not that kind of person. I always have different kinds of things to do … for me, it’s also important that you have something out[side] of football.” Her coaching work, she says, gives her a sense of “freedom, for me, to help people”. It has helped in her playing career, too, because she makes her own nutrition plans (“I always have carrots with me!” she jokes). “It’s given me a lot of structure, that I have to be prepared; I’m a really prepared person,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/19/reading-sanne-troelsgaard-denmark-online-fitness-company-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Parks evokes the terror of Covid’s early days in a novel that reminds us to be kind while we can</p><p>In Tim Parks’s essay <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2012/03/13/why-finish-books/">Why Finish Books?</a> he admits to abandoning reading novels halfway through, eager to start something new. “Might it be,” he asks, “that, in showing a willingness not to pursue even an excellent book to the death, you are actually doing the writer a favour, exonerating him or her from the near-impossible task of getting out of the plot gracefully?”</p><p>It’s tempting to obey this impulse reading Parks’s new novel, the story of 75-year-old Frank Marriot’s incarceration in a Milan hotel as Covid sends Italy into its first lockdown. Though the prose is as smooth as the cabernet Frank sips, dining alone while the world disintegrates around him, one can’t see how the dramatic situation can be resolved without resorting to inelegant contrivances or a crashing deus ex machina. After all, when it comes to Covid, one has the benefit of three harrowing years of hindsight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/19/hotel-milano-by-tim-parks-review-a-pandemic-reckoning">Continue reading...</a>

## Saved by a rainy day? Californians ‘harvest’ water during historic storms

<p>Faced with a sudden influx of water, residents of drought-struck California ask how to keep it around for good</p><p>When Kitty Bolte looked at her yard at the start of California’s powerful winter storms, she saw more than half a foot of standing water behind her house. At first Bolte, a horticulturalist by trade, contemplated pumping it out onto the street. But with the historic rains coming in the midst of a historic drought, that seemed oddly wasteful.</p><p>So instead, she and her boyfriend decided to save it. They found a neighbor selling IBC totes – large 330-gallon plastic containers surrounded by wire – on Craigslist, and filled them up using an inexpensive Home Depot pump. They also dragged some spare garbage cans outside to sit under the downpour, gathering 800 gallons in all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/19/california-water-harvesting-historic-storms-drought">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is no such thing as a safe level of alcohol consumption, according to new guidelines from Canada. What does this mean for moderate drinkers?</p><p>If you are halfway through dry January, and counting the days until you can drink again, the latest news from Canada might make you rethink. Its <a href="https://ccsa.ca/more-6-drinks-week-puts-your-health-risk-new-canadas-guidance-alcohol-and-health">new alcohol guidelines</a> suggest people drink no more than two alcoholic drinks a week. Two small glasses of wine or a pint and a half of beer a week is what is considered by Canadian health experts as low-risk – a sharp drop from the previous guidelines of no more than 10 drinks a week for women and 15 for men – while no alcohol at all is the only safe limit.</p><p>In the UK, our limits are more generous, though the direction they are going in is towards Canada’s. When they were last <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-alcohol-guidelines-show-increased-risk-of-cancer">updated in 2016</a>, the upper limit for both men and women was set at 14 units: the equivalent of <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-advice/calculating-alcohol-units/">seven pints of lower-strength beer</a> or nine small (125ml) glasses of wine. Previously, men had been advised to stay below 21 units a week. The UK’s chief medical officers also made it clear that “there is no level of regular drinking that can be considered as completely safe”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/19/the-99-sober-movement-should-we-keep-dry-january-going-all-year">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Latest updates: prime minister to make series of visits across north-east to promote levelling up funding </p><p>This morning the Times has splashed on claims that the levelling up awards announced today favour the south-east of England over the Midlands and the north. In <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/levelling-up-cash-favours-southeast-over-red-wall-c2b77tr89">its story</a> it says this has infuriated Tory MPs in “red wall” seats – constituencies outside the south-east that were won from Labour at the last election. It says:</p><p>The £2 billion-plus fund is shared between 111 communities across the UK as part of the second round of <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-and-levelling-up-how-will-a-music-venue-and-a-few-flats-solve-decades-of-neglect-mwlrrnmcx">levelling-up funding</a>. In England 52 Tory constituencies benefit, more than twice as many as those represented by Labour MPs.</p><p>However, Tory MPs in seats in the north and Midlands who missed out have accused <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/rishi-sunak">Sunak</a> of favouring the south. One Tory MP in the northwest said it made a “mockery of levelling up” and added: “A government that U-turned on a minister for the north is delivering for the south once again.”</p><p><strong>Gove rejected claims that London and the south-east of England were benefiting most.</strong> He told Times Radio:</p><p>If you look per capita at the amount we’re spending, the biggest winners are those in the north-west and of course, yes there is some spending in London and the south-east, but there are some areas of deprivation in London and the south-east but it’s overwhelmingly the case that the areas that benefit the most are the north-west, the north-east and the east Midlands.</p><p>It’s simply untrue that the levelling up fund is concentrated disproportionately on London and the south-east.</p><p><strong>He said it was right to spend levelling up money in the south-east because there were poor areas there. </strong>He said:</p><p>When you’ve got a region like the south-east which has such a large proportion of the UK population but also has within it particular areas of deprivation, it’s natural that there should be money there.</p><p>But the money in the south-east has gone to areas like Swale and Dover in Kent which I think, again, everyone would recognise those coastal communities in Kent are areas where levelling up is important.</p><p><strong>He said that Wales was the area that had done best overall, on a per capita basis.</strong> This tweet, from <strong>Rob Parsons</strong> from the Northern Agenda newsletter, confirms this.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jan/19/rishi-sunak-levelling-up-keir-starmer-conservatives-labour-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Albert Hall, London<br /></strong>Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s choreography connects amazing talents from yo-yoers to contortionists in a slick and seamless show</p><p>It’s how visceral your reactions can be, that’s the appeal of circus. A lurching stomach when an aerialist plummets towards the floor, or an involuntary gasp when an acrobat nails a tricky catch. So, when someone jumps the full height of the Royal Albert Hall on a giant trampoline, and your heart leaps to join them, that’s pure joy; vicariously free and flying, all from the safety of your seat.</p><p>Cirque du Soleil has been performing for almost 40 years and knows how to push our buttons. The company excels in large-scale spectacle, gathering some of the best acts from around the globe. In Kurios, the theme stringing those acts together is a steampunk world of retro-futuristic inventions: it’s hot air balloons and madcap Heath Robinson machines, rivets, bolts and leather flying goggles, and eccentrically shaped characters like something from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/nov/24/oskar-schlemmers-ballet-of-geometry-in-pictures">Oskar Schlemmer’s Triadic Ballet</a>.</p><p>At the <a href="https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/events/2023/cirque-du-soleil-kurios-cabinet-of-curiosities/">Royal Albert Hall, London</a>, until 5 March. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/19/cirque-du-soleil-kurios-review-a-gasp-inducing-steampunk-celebration-of-virtuosity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Decades of study expose this legislation as the perfect playbook for turning peaceful events into scenes of chaos and disorder</p><p>The government is to introduce legislation this week that, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/15/police-to-get-new-powers-to-shut-down-protests-before-disruption-begins">according to Downing Street</a>, is designed to stop such heinous tactics as “slow marching”, and will mean that police “will not need to wait for disruption to take place and can shut protests down before chaos erupts”.</p><p>As I read this story, it seemed strangely familiar.

<p>Local cooperatives can offer an alternative to food banks, allowing neighbours to club together while tackling food waste</p><p>In a large, bright room in Gospel Oak, north-west London, 20 green plastic boxes have been arranged on the floor in an approximate circle. Four volunteers are moving between them, putting food items into each: a packet of cornflakes, bags of rice, four oranges, a handful of large mushrooms.</p><p>Before long – a mango, a jar of chickpeas – the boxes are almost full. From a large sack, one of the volunteers takes a fistful of garlic bulbs to drop in each container: “It’s winter. People need garlic,” she says with a grin. These crammed, healthy boxes of food will go a long way to feeding a family each week.

<p>Fifty years on from that Barbarians game, the feats of the wing, who died last week, still look astonishing if you can find them</p><p>There are videos of David Duckham out there, but not as many as you’d hope. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSsnd3XhrYA">twisting run past three All Blacks</a> in that match against the Barbarians in ’73 is online, so is his whirlwind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-KD6NQl7PQ">sprint down the wing against Scotland</a> in that year’s Five Nations, in what they called the greatest try never scored at Twickenham (and there’s a conversation), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqPLHy02IPo">his side-step around Roger Blyth</a> to score the opener when England played Wales in ’74. There’s a sharp finish, “one of his specials”, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MG5q8huBRE">for Coventry against London Scottish</a> in the Cup final later that same year, and bits and pieces of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiJChmhe9A4">Lions tour to New Zealand</a> in ’71, when he scored 11 tries in 16 games.</p><p>Nothing that I can find, though, of the one Duckham, who died last week aged 76, scored on debut against Ireland at Lansdowne Road in ’69. “Duckham at once fed Rod Webb, his friend on the wing, and then looped round him for the return pass and a glorious, glorious try in the corner,” Frank Keating wrote in this paper a few years later. “The nation exalted, and the official history still calls it the most daring try of recent years.” England’s history, maybe, but the one that counts is written by the winners. Ireland edged it 17-15 and Duckham’s try didn’t make the edit in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPcYDBJgkgU">their documentary about the game</a>. “I suppose I should have dived to make it perfect,” he said afterwards, “but the ground was hard and frosty.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/19/david-duckham-was-the-romantics-dream-and-every-defenders-nightmare">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the ocean floor to outer space, an astonishing novel examines our place in the universe</p><p>It is an inalienable convention of fiction that a mystery entails a solution. Imagine a whodunnit in which the murderer is never revealed! Readers would howl in frustration.</p><p>It would be wrong to suggest that Scottish writer Martin MacInnes cheats the reader of the satisfactions of solution. He is not a frustrating or peekaboo author: quite the reverse. And yet, though his novels tell stories that hang on mysteries, his distinctiveness as a writer does not depend on plot reveals. In his first novel, 2016’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/05/infinite-ground-martin-macinnes-review">Infinite Ground</a>, a middle-aged man disappears during a family meal, and an eminent detective is brought in to investigate. But as the investigation proceeds, throwing up other mysteries as it goes, the understanding grows in the reader that something more than a missing persons narrative is under way. At the risk of sounding pretentious, I’d say the real mystery of Infinite Ground is our very existence, and its relationship with the world into which we are born.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/19/in-ascension-by-martin-macinnes-review-cosmic-wonder">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Euphoria’s Storm Reid makes for a compelling detective in an inventive, if increasingly far-fetched and overly sentimental, follow-up to the 2018 mystery</p><p>It seemed, for a brief moment, that film-makers had crafted an entirely new way of watching a thriller back in the mid-2010s. After the found footage boom had started to lose audiences and all sense of logic (if you didn’t scream “why the hell are you still filming?” at a screen in that era then you really didn’t live), an even cheaper-to-produce subgenre emerged, replacing a shaky cam with one that never even moves at all. Films such as Unfriended, Open Windows and The Den <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/23/unfriended-hollywood-darkest-digital-fears">took place entirely on someone’s laptop screen</a>, a cyber-horror update that was supposed to resonate with an audience whose lives also did the same.</p><p>But it wasn’t until a few years later, in 2018, when Aneesh Chaganty’s nifty debut <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/29/searching-review-satnav-cctv-and-social-media-fuel-missing-daughter-mystery">Searching</a> truly maximised the new medium, focusing less on demons and more on detectives. His film saw a single dad, played by John Cho, desperately search for help online to track down his missing daughter. A mystery was solved in ways that we often solve lesser mysteries ourselves, with internet assistance. It was a deserved hit but five years later, when we’re even further from what ended up being less a big new trend and more a tiny blip, a spin-off/sequel lands in cinemas, audience interest to be determined.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/19/missing-review-searching-sequel-offers-more-laptop-based-thrills">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kendrick impresses as a woman being deprived of emotional oxygen by a toxic boyfriend, though Mary Nighy’s film gets distracted by a subplot</p><p>Anna Kendrick gives a vehement, self-aware lead performance in this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/08/victorian-melodrama-gaslight-love-island-psychological-abuse-patrick-hamilton-play-buzzword">Gaslight</a>-style suspense drama about a young woman trapped in a coercive, abusive relationship from screenwriter Alanna Francis and debut feature director Mary Nighy. There are some edge-of-the-seat moments and interestingly subtle tonal inflexions, though the story spends time on a contrived subplot about a missing girl, time that might have been better devoted to developing the central thriller storyline.</p><p>Alice (Kendrick) is in a toxic relationship with Simon (Charlie Carrick), an arrogant, controlling man with an uncertain career as an artist, in constant need of reassurance and always tracking Alice’s movements. When Alice is allowed out for a rare evening at a bar with her two best friends Tess (Kaniehtiio Horn) and Sophie (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jun/03/wunmi-mosaku-im-black-in-america-my-feeling-about-the-police-is-im-scared">Wunmi Mosaku</a>), we can see how glassy-eyed Alice’s smile is, how tensely distracted, how she flinches at each ping from her phone. She is no longer the vivacious friend Tess and Sophie once knew and loved; she appears to have issues with food and her hair is thin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/19/alice-darling-review-anna-kendrick-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

## NatWest’s biometric app security is blinking annoying

<p>It has introduced facial recognition, but does not recognise me</p><p><strong>NatWest recently introduced biometric approval on its app for transactions such as payments to a new account. It requires customers to look into the phone and blink (presumably to show we’re alive and not corpses propped up in front of the camera by some fraudster). And, in my experience, it hardly ever works. I’ve just sat here for four minutes, blinking like an idiot with the app telling me to move the camera closer until it’s virtually up my nose, until the approval time expired. This has been my repeated experience. Very annoying. But from a quick browse online I see I’m not alone.<br /></strong><em><strong>CM, London</strong></em></p><p>You are not alone. Review websites resound with the ire of NatWest customers locked out of their accounts because the facial recognition technology does not recognise their faces. It is, of course, a good thing that banks are stepping up security to prevent fraud, although facial recognition software is controversial, and other banks seem to have introduced biometrics without such hitches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/19/natwests-biometric-app-security-is-blinking-annoying">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Every morning I check myself on the scales and then take my blood pressure. So far, my new year’s resolution is holding strong</p><p>Nearly three weeks into 2023 and, unprecedently, my new year’s resolution is intact. It concerns data – specifically, health data, my health data – and I’m proud to say my data’s up to date. First thing every morning, I weigh myself. This is more of a fiddle than it should be because, <em>sans</em> specs, I can’t see the numbers. And I don’t want to wear my glasses (or anything else for that matter) because, like a boxer or jockey trying to make the weight, every gram counts. So I climb aboard, wait until the numbers stop flashing, then leap off, bend down and read them in the two seconds they give you before clearing the screen. It’s quite a good workout in itself.</p><p>Then, with a spring in my step (if I’ve lost weight) or a heavy heart (if I haven’t) I make my way downstairs to take my blood pressure. Thereafter, depending on my overall numbers, I fight off either self-love or self-loathing as I make a cup of tea. It’s a high-stakes start to the day, I tell you.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/the-data-doesnt-lie-i-seem-to-be-winning-my-war-on-weight">Continue reading...</a>

## The ‘virgin speculum’: proof that medicine is still rife with outrageous myths about women | Jenny Halpern Prince

<p>No wonder fewer British women are attending cervical screenings when some in the medical profession have such outdated views</p><p>An invitation to a cervical screening test upon your 25th birthday has become a necessary but often unwanted coming-of-age present. Despite years of education and advocacy from the Lady Garden Foundation and others about the benefits of screening, many women still do not attend. About 16 million women in the UK aged 25-64 are eligible for testing, but only <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11465815/Only-seven-10-eligible-women-smear-tests-year-cervical-cancer-screening-rates-plummet.html">11.2 million took a test in 2022</a>, the lowest level in a decade.</p><p>There unfortunately remains a false narrative that there are good reasons to be nervous about cervical screening tests. In reality, the test is not physically painful for the vast majority of women, although it can be a bit uncomfortable. However, the test can be needlessly emotionally painful, and for no good reason. This is in part because some women go through the experience of sitting with legs spread apart and “private parts” out, and then hear the nurse call for “the virgin speculum” to be used.</p><p>Jenny Halpern Prince is a co-founder of the Lady Garden Foundation</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>Picturesque Nzulezo attracts a steady stream of tourists to Lake Tadane. But the waters that draws visitors are the very reason school staff are reluctant to stay</p><p>In west Ghana, the village of Nzulezo perches above the dark water of Lake Tadane, backed by dense swampland. Built entirely on wooden stilts and platforms carved from raffia palms, the cluster of structures is home to more than 500 people, with two churches, a small guesthouse, a bar and primary school.</p><p>Nominated in 2000 for inclusion as a Unesco world heritage site, the village is on the bucket list of visitors to the west African country, curious about a unique way of life on the water. But the vast lake that makes this place so picturesque is also the reason no one wants to work here, especially teachers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jan/19/ghana-school-on-stilts-floating-village-nzulezo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is impossible to understand China without understanding this decade of horror, and the ways in which it scarred the entire nation. So why do some of that era’s children still look back on it with fondness?</p><p>From a distance, you might have mistaken them for teenagers, though they were in late middle age. It wasn’t just the miniskirts and heels on their slim frames, or the ponytails and flaming lipstick, but the girlish way the women held hands, stroked arms, massaged shoulders, smoothed sleeves and straightened bag straps, giddy with affection. Their makeup was heavy, with boldly pencilled brows, and their long hair tinted black or dyed brassy blond – recreating a youth that had never been theirs to enjoy.</p><p>Auntie Huang was wistful as we watched a couple of students stroll past in the grounds of Chongqing University, green with palms and willows and great thickets of bamboo. We had made ourselves at home in a little pavilion set upon the lake.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/tragedy-pushed-to-the-shadows-truth-about-china-cultural-revolution">Continue reading...</a>

She started using the brand’s “super absorbent” style after she bled for weeks post-partum.
