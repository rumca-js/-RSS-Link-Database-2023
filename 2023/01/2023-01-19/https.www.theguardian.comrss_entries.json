Baldwin accidentally fired a live bullet from a revolver being used as a prop. Now he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/19/rust-film-set-shooting-criminal-charges-alec-baldwin\">faces criminal charges</a> of involuntary manslaughter, despite a private legal settlement Baldwin reportedly reached with the Hutchins family.<br /><br />Alec Baldwin\u2019s mercurial, defiant, combatively emotional behaviour \u2013 which has been part of his presence as a performer and public figure \u2013 has been in evidence since the shooting. He gave an emotional interview last August in which he blamed the armourer and the props assistant but declined to blame himself and even exhibited notes of histrionic self-pity, talking about the acting jobs he had lost and thanked his wife, Hilaria: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have my wife, I don\u2019t know where I would be right now \u2026\u201d Not a tactful thing to say, with Matt Hutchins mourning the loss of his wife.</p><p><br />Baldwin has no obvious desire to make a penitent retreat from the spotlight. Last month, he hosted the glitzy Ripple Of Hope ceremony in New York City, conferring the award on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for their activism on racial justice, pointedly praising their handling of \u201cdifficult circumstances in the press\u201d and joking that he could be their \u201cdriver\u201d. It was precisely the kind of celebrity-liberal nexus in which Baldwin is so bullishly at home.<br />Baldwin began his movie career as a hunky male lead in movies such as Working Girl (1988) and The Hunt For Red October (1990) but he morphed (and bulked out) into a complex, potent character actor \u2013 while often lamenting his failure to clinch Hollywood alpha status. It was a career pivot signalled by his unforgettable cameo as the bullying salesman in the movie version of David Mamet\u2019s Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), snarling: \u201cAlways be closing.\u201d In this new persona, he worked with directors like Woody Allen (of whom he has been a great defender) and Martin Scorsese, and got an Oscar nomination for his tremendous performance in Wayne Kramer\u2019s enigmatic Vegas drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1241206,.html\">The Cooler</a>.<br /><br />But his celebrity brand got a turbocharge from his almost incessant appearances in the gossip media for chaotic behaviour: he separated with maximum acrimony from his wife Kim Basinger, and in a furious voicemail directed at his preteen daughter, leaked to the press, he called her \u201ca rude, thoughtless little pig\u201d, in that unmistakable bass rasp. He hit a paparazzo, got thrown off a plane for refusing to put away his electronic device, responded with icy resentment when Hilaria\u2019s claims to a Spanish background were mocked, and furiously attacked the Daily Mail for suggesting that she had been tweeting during James Gandolfini\u2019s funeral.<br /><br />In effect, he became the real-life Mr Hyde to the likable \u2013 and brilliantly written and performed \u2013 Dr Jekyll persona created for him by Tina Fey in the TV comedy 30 Rock: Jack Donaghy, the cheerfully reactionary Republican television producer who has nothing but contempt for liberals. Baldwin also had a longstanding turn on Saturday Night Live playing Donald Trump.<br /><br />When I interviewed Baldwin, I saw for myself how this complicated, fraught, charming man was perpetually \u201con\u201d: like many journalists who met him, I found that it was like talking to Jack Donaghy, how Baldwin loved making people laugh, or at least thrill to his serio-comic, wolfishly grinning presence. His comedy career was very important to him. Watch his appearance opposite Jerry Seinfeld on the web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, and you\u2019ll see \u2013 despite all the laughs and kidding around \u2013 how wounded and sensitive he is, how desperate for super-celebrity status like Seinfeld\u2019s. He is a brooding, saturnine presence.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/19/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-involuntary-manslaughter-charges-analysis\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/19/tory-seats-gain-more-4bn-levelling-up-fund-finds-analysis", "title": "\u2018Slap in the face\u2019: Tory seats gain more from \u00a34bn levelling up fund, finds analysis", "date_published": "2023-01-19 19:23:50+00:00", "description": "<p>Exclusive: council leaders accuse Rishi Sunak of offering \u2018pre-election bribes\u2019 as many deprived areas miss out</p><p>Tory seats have been awarded significantly more money per person from the government\u2019s \u00a34bn levelling up fund than areas with similar levels of deprivation, a Guardian analysis has found.</p><p>The disclosure is bound to provoke further fury from some regional leaders, who on Thursday accused Rishi Sunak of offering \u201cpre election bribes\u201d.

At this week\u2019s prime minister questions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jan/18/nurse-train-teachers-anti-strikes-bill-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-pmqs-uk-politics-live\">he was tackled by Labour\u2019s Alex Sobel</a> about the reports that the chairman of the Tory party, Nadhim Zahawi, was \u201cforced to pay millions to Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs [HMRC] to settle a tax dispute\u201d. The prime minister responded that his colleague had \u201calready addressed this matter in full\u201d, but he was wrong. Mr Zahawi is an able communicator, yet on this he has been unforthcoming, not denying the reports about capital gains tax incurred by the sale of a \u00a320m stake in YouGov by a family trust, only saying his taxes \u201care properly declared and paid in the UK\u201d.</p><p>That sounds odd: someone who has fully declared their taxes does not reach a big settlement with HMRC. Ministerial colleagues have said, <a href=\"https://perspectivemag.co.uk/minister-defends-ex-chancellor-nadhim-zahawi-over-his-tax-affairs/\">as Robert Jenrick did</a> this week, that it is a \u201cprivate matter\u201d and HMRC rightly does not comment on individuals\u2019 tax affairs. Mr Zahawi is not being accused of criminal tax evasion. Yet the very notion that a chancellor of the exchequer \u2013 as Mr Zahawi was last summer, serving twice as long as the hapless Kwasi Kwarteng \u2013 should be setting the taxes of the country while striking a deal on his own tax affairs would seem an extraordinary conflict of interest. Mr Zahawi may have done nothing wrong, but the public deserves to know the truth. Without some accountability, the tax system will lose a little more legitimacy.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-tax-system-losing-trust-missing-out-on-billions\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/19/shakhtar-darijo-srna-fifa-ukraine-russia-mudryk", "title": "Shakhtar\u2019s Darijo Srna: \u2018We feel we\u2019re fighting not only against Russia but Fifa too\u2019", "date_published": "2023-01-19 18:13:56+00:00", "description": "<p>Director of football on Mudryk\u2019s move, club president Akhmetov\u2019s donation to help Ukraine and why he feels let down by Fifa</p><p>Almost 11 months have passed since Darijo Srna left Kyiv, not knowing when or if he would return. \u201cRussia has not stopped,\u201d he says. \u201cLook what they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/16/ukraine-death-toll-rises-from-russian-missile-strike-on-dnipro\">did in Dnipro</a> a few days ago: 40 people dead.

So far we\u2019ve put forward the theory that J\u00fcrgen Klopp will never smile again, suggested that Wolverhampton Wanderers were looking good for a first FA Cup since 1960, and tipped Manchester United for the title. That whopping three for zero was confirmed late on Wednesday night when Michael Olise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/18/crystal-palace-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">whistled an astonishing free-kick</a> past David de Gea\u2019s lugs before pointedly not bothering to celebrate, in the manner of a player who had just denied his previous club a couple of precious points and wanted to showcase some maximum respect. You can bet your last penny Wilfried Zaha won\u2019t hold back like that if he ever scores a last-minute zinger against Reading.</p><p>Since clubs being in crisis is the favo(u)rite subject of Football Daily, you might want to look over the pond where all five official supporters groups of the LA Galaxy have come together to boycott all games until club president Chris Klein is shown a certain door marked with specific verbiage.

Watching football on the TV, I see many managers resort to traditional ways (biros, scraps of paper, etc) in noting something or other, hoping to impart half-time flannel to thwart a defeat. Thus, I have begun an art project encapsulating their scribbled jottings. Titled \u2018Managers\u2019 Notebooks\u2019 (not digital since that would be a Klopp-out), it is a collection of drawings and prints that attempt to represent the turmoils of watching self-inflicted escapism/optimism. I rely on the hopeless shrug of a Moyes or a Lampard, the panicky Conte <a href=\"https://www.montegrappa.com/\">Montegrappa</a> or a Rodgers slap and others. These, intertwined with odd numbers, like Neto 13 and diagrammatic representations of a dis-United 5\u2019s elusive defensive runs, should end up as a Picasso-like exploration of the game.

There has been an endemic lack of respect for video games from decades\u2019 worth of film-makers who, in the words of games satire site Hard Drive News, have been excited to take a beloved franchise and adapt it into something <a href=\"https://hard-drive.net/filmmaker-honored-for-opportunity-to-take-beloved-video-game-franchise-and-adapt-it-into-something-not-for-dumb-little-babies/\">not for dumb little babies</a>.</p><p>HBO\u2019s The Last of Us finally marks the end of this era. There\u2019s been a shift in the tenor of game adaptations in the past few years; you could tell that Detective Pikachu was written by huge Pok\u00e9mon fans, Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Netflix series was actually better than the game, and the plot of Paramount\u2019s TV version of the military space-opera Halo is just as ponderous and self-important as the games. But the close involvement of The Last of Us co-creator Neil Druckmann in the TV series takes HBO\u2019s adaptation to another level. The Last of Us doesn\u2019t just preserve the premise and characters of the game; it tells us something new about them.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/19/the-last-of-us-video-game-tv-adaptation-triumph\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/19/comoros-fa-president-says-team-cheated-at-afcon-positive-covid-tests-ghana", "title": "Comoros FA head says team \u2018cheated\u2019 at Afcon over positive Covid tests", "date_published": "2023-01-19 12:59:58+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Comments about Ghana game made in wedding speech</li><li>Athouman now says everyone who played was negative</li></ul><p>The president of the Comoros Football Association has claimed that members of the country\u2019s team \u201ccheated\u201d by playing at last year\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations after testing positive for Covid.</p><p>Comoros defied expectations at their first Afcon finals by reaching the last 16 after eliminating Ghana thanks to a thrilling 3-2 victory in their final group match.

Whatever your musical predictions for 2021 were, they definitely didn\u2019t include an international breakthrough by the runners-up of the Italian X Factor. They were unexpectedly propelled to global stardom by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/22/eurovision-2021-maneskin-triumphs-for-italy-in-rotterdam\">victory in the Eurovision song contest</a> and a viral surge in the popularity of their cover of the Four Seasons\u2019 1967 hit Beggin\u2019. M\u00e5neskin\u2019s version takes its cues not from the original, but a 21st-century version by Norwegian hip-hop duo Madcon. Initially, M\u00e5neskin\u2019s success seemed to be the type that came with the inbuilt tang of short-lived novelty; instead things just seemed to escalate: a support slot on the Rolling Stones\u2019 US tour; a collaboration with Iggy Pop; an appearance on the soundtrack of Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis biopic; more than 6.5bn streams. At the end of summer 2022, a point by which observers might reasonably have assumed M\u00e5neskin\u2019s 15 minutes would long be over, they were instead in a position to sack-off an appearance at the Reading and Leeds festival because they had a better offer: an appearance at the MTV VMAs, at which they walked off with the best alternative video award.</p><p>Perhaps M\u00e5neskin are rather sharper operators than the unexpectedly-propelled-to-global-fame narrative implies. Listening to Rush!, their first album with lyrics primarily in English, you\u2019re struck by how canny their sound is. Once purveyors of wan funk-rock in the vein of the Red Hot Chili Peppers \u2013 a sound that netted vast success in their homeland \u2013 they gave themselves an overhaul shortly before Eurovision, while temporarily residing in London: the only track on Rush! that resembles Flea and co is the lumbering La Fine, which is also the worst thing here. These days, the label that\u2019s most frequently attached to them is glam, but that seems largely rooted in their penchant for flared catsuits and lyrical expressions of non-specific rebellion: \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t give a fuck / I\u2019m addicted to rock\u2019n\u2019roll, yeah,\u201d frontman Damiano David barks on Kool Kids, a song that also offers the band\u2019s disinclination to use dental floss as evidence of their wild-eyed outsider status. Certainly, the glam tag has almost nothing to do with the music: Read Your Diary features glam drums, but somehow feels like it has more in common with the 00s pop that also used that rhythm \u2013 Katy Perry\u2019s I Kissed a Girl, Britney Spears\u2019 Womanizer \u2013 than the oeuvre of Slade or Sweet.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/19/maneskin-rush-review-eurovision-winners-extend-their-improbable-15-minutes-of-fame\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-UK", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/19/the-rheumcom-how-romantic-comedies-set-out-to-attract-the-more-mature-lover", "title": "The rheumcom: how romantic comedies set out to attract the more mature lover", "date_published": "2023-01-19 12:00:08+00:00", "description": "<p>After a lean decade, the 90s staple has returned in a big way.
