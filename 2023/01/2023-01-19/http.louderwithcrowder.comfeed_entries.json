His lawyer stated they plan to fight the charges and called the decision \"a terrible miscarriage of justice.\" </p><p>The circumstances surrounding the shooting have long been a source of confusion. Baldwin was apparently practicing a cross-draw when he pointed the gun at Hutchins and pulled the trigger. </p><p>Later on, Baldwin claimed he actually <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alec-baldwin-abc-interview\" target=\"_blank\">didn't pull </a>the trigger. He said he would never point a gun at someone and pull the trigger. Except for that one time when he did and it killed someone. But that was a one-off. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cEXCLUSIVE: \"The trigger wasn't pulled.

Thanks, FBI. Now, get back to ignoring red flags from future mass shooters. It's what you do best. </p><p>In Baldwin's defense, there may be a little bit of blame to go around here. Though most of it definitely rests on him, and not on Halyna Hutchins. Yes, he did really try to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alec-baldwin-blames\" target=\"_blank\">blame</a> the woman he shot for her own death. Since he would never, ever pull a trigger. His fingers don't even bend in that direction. <br /></p><p>Armorer Gutierrez-Reed, who is also facing charges, allegedly has a history of less-than-stellar safety practices onset. Namely, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting\" target=\"_blank\">handing</a> an 11-year-old actor an unchecked gun. In the biz, they refer to this as a \"<em>no-no.\"</em> </p><p>She also <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nicholas-cage-rust-armorer\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a> fired a gun near the cast and crew of a Nicholas Cage movie without warning. Twice. This prompted Cage to yell, <em>\"Make an announcement, you just blew my f***ing eardrums out!\"  </em></p><p>This is obviously a very serious topic, but it makes a little more sense once you learn Gutierrez-Reed was a frequent TikToker. Her last brain cells were probably hanging on for dear life. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cThis was the person in charge of firearms on Baldwin's production, no joke. @JUSTcatmeme2\\u201d</div> \u2014 Franklin\\u300c\\ud835\\udc79\\u300dSheckler \\ud83d\\udca1 (@Franklin\\u300c\\ud835\\udc79\\u300dSheckler \\ud83d\\udca1)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FDSheckler/status/1451863147401338882\">1634986123</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though Baldwin's refusal to admit his guilt is frustrating, hopefully, Halyna's family can find some peace in the charges filed. And maybe Baldwin will finally learn some basic gun safety.

When you are like me and you get to a point where you view the world as \"content\" over \"news,\" <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/george-santos-admits\" target=\"_blank\">how can you not enjoy it</a>? Every day is a new story about this man's fabricated background. True, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/18/politics/george-santos-veteran-dog-gofundme/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">the story about the veteran dog is gross</a>. But wearing a stolen scarf to a \"stop the steal\" rally? Running an anonymous Twitter account with a raccoon profile picture? This sh*t is hysterical.</p><p>And now, it appears Santos is a former drag queen.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">NEW: I just spoke by phone with Eula Rochard, a Brazilian drag queen who was friends with George Santos when he lived near Rio. She said everyone knew him as Anthony (*never* George), or by his drag name, Kitara, and confirms this photo is from a 2008 drag show at Icara\u00ed Beach. <a href=\"https://t.co/1MeeDR1O2O\">pic.twitter.com/1MeeDR1O2O</a><br />\u2014 Marisa Kabas (@MarisaKabas) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarisaKabas/status/1615808517176234020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 18, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Santos used to perform as \"Kitara\" in Brazil. Yes, the Santos story has hit Brazil. Where one of Santos' colleagues saw him on the news and said \"wait, I know that queen!\" She (or he?) dug up an old photo, shared it with friends, and it made its way to an MSNBC reporter.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Eula saw a story about Santos on Brazilian news and was sure was it was him. She shared the news with a group of friends and everyone doubted her. So she looked for an old picture to confirm, and she decided to post it to social media to<br />prove to her friends that she was right.<br />\u2014 Marisa Kabas (@MarisaKabas) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarisaKabas/status/1615813082780995599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 18, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The MSNBC reporter doesn't find it as amusing as I do. She believes drag is, quote, \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/florida-family-friendly\" target=\"_blank\">beautiful</a>.\" And in another tweet lashed out at republicans who believe <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-meeting-mom-dresses\" target=\"_blank\">it's wrong</a> to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-kid-rock\" target=\"_blank\">expose children</a> to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/family-friendly-school-board\" target=\"_blank\">raunchy burlesque acts</a>. But I'm making the decision to find this hilarious. I was born that way.</p><p>I had this conversation with a neighbor yesterday about the perfect storm that allowed George Santos to happen. He ran for a congressional seat that no other Republican wanted, in a district the GOP didn't think they could win and the DNC didn't think they could lose, and the media didn't invest resources in as a result. No one was paying attention or even cared. What dumb luck!</p><p>When it comes primary time next year, I will not be voting for Santos. I'm hoping former Assemblyman Mike LiPetri throws his name in the mix. But until then, I'm going to keep laughing. I find this all to be very entertaining.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

Ben Savage has filed for congress in California's 30th congressional district. Yes, it's the seat held by Adam Schiff. Yes, Ben Savage from <em>Boy Meets World</em>. Cory Mathews is running for Congress.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"98af5\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32872518&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>I'm more of an 80s kid, though on the cusp of being a 90s kid. 90s kids were all about Cory and Mr. Feeny. I was more about Kevin Arnold and the dude who played the voice of <em>Knight Rider</em>. You elder millennials might be more excited about this. But while <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adam-schiff-twitter-sperry\" target=\"_blank\">Adam \"Piece Of\" Schiff</a> is considering a run for senate, Savage is one of the names preparing to replace him.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">In 2024 election news, it seems 'Boy Meets World' actor Ben Savage has registered to run as a Dem for the CA-30th seat currently held by Rep. Adam Schiff.<br />Sources confirmed to Spectrum in Nov. that Schiff was eyeing a Senate bid. Schiff's camp had no comment on Savage's filing. <a href=\"https://t.co/KhEm4UPnXJ\">pic.twitter.com/KhEm4UPnXJ</a><br />\u2014 Cassie Semyon (@casssemyon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/casssemyon/status/1615814511331807232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 18, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Before anyone gets too excited that Cory is a secret conservative, the actor is running as a Democrat. And running in a Congressional district that is a D+23. Whoever gets the democrat nomination is the new congressman. Unless a miracle happens and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mexico-americans-gentrification\" target=\"_blank\">enough California leftists move to Mexico where it's cheaper</a> and a republican can sneak in on election day.</p><p>It also depends on if Schiff runs for the Senate. A lot of California Democrats are looking forward to current Senator Dianne Feinstein either retiring or dying and creating an open seat. Though in <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/katie-porter-wounded-warrior\" target=\"_blank\">the case of Rep. Katie Porter</a>, she's impatient and isn't waiting for the body to be cold. She has already announced she running. Schiff is still only a maybe.</p><p>I'm not sure Savage knows what he's in for. Democrats love actors when they are out there repeating the talking points that were sent to their PR team. When it comes to political power and what will amount to a lifelong congressional seat, Democrats are the dirtiest players in the game. Just saying, older brother Fred was yeeted off of the <em>Wonder Years</em> reboot due to<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/fred-savage-misconduct-the-wonder-years-1235194998/\" target=\"_blank\"> \"misconduct toward several women on the production.\"</a> Not to mention he allegedly got handsy with the actress who played his mother during the original series. If Democrats smell power, there is a zero percent chance they don't use that as a campaign issue against Ben.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d0b63\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32872544&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>But stranger things have happened. Look at George Santos. Plus if Savage runs, I'm sure Danielle Fishel would hit the campaign trail with him. More Topanga is better than less Topanga.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

Last night on Fox News, Tucker Carlson told an African basketball player to go back to his home country if he refused to wear an American flag pin. Nah, just kidding. It was actually NHL Network analyst E.J. Hradek telling Philadelphia Flyers player Ivan Provorov, who is from Russia, that he should hop on a plane and leave if he won't wear the rainbow jersey.

The NHL was being shamed over too many cis white men enjoying their product all at once. Because the league is headquartered in NYC, they had to appease the woke. While not confirmed, I'm sure a diversity consultant and their insane monthly retainer were brought on.</p><p>They attempted to have a job fair that discriminated against able-bodied white men <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nhl-job-fair-florida\" target=\"_self\">until Ron DeSantis said \"not in Florida.\"</a></p><p>The next initiative was \"hockey is for everyone\" where the league demanded all players wear a practice jersey with a rainbow NHL logo when they warmed up. Saying that something is \"for everyone\" is believed to be the only way LGBTQAIIP2EIEIO-Americans know they are allowed to watch something.</p><p>One lone player, Ivan Provorov, didn't want to wear the jersey citing his religious beliefs. He quietly did not practice. While the jersey was not for him, he also said \"<em>I respect everyone. I respect everybody\u2019s choices.\" </em>My guess is coming from Russia, he believed America was the place where you are allowed to have your own opinion.</p><p>The media made it clear: NOPE. There are consequences for having an opinion the media doesn't like. They went into <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nhl-pride-jersey-ivan-provorov\" target=\"_blank\">full-blown meltdown mode</a> because the one guy didn't do what he was told. Ten bucks say gay hockey fans don't give a sh*t that one player didn't wear a shirt. If anything, they would prefer none of the players wore shirts.  But woke media members and other journalismers have their virtue to signal and they are going to signal that virtue until it burns out.</p><p>That includes this dickhead Hradek telling the lone hockey player who made a decision that Hradek didn't like that if he won't conform...he should go back to Russia. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
