We\u2019re Eden and Ari, co-founders of Odigos (<a href=\"https://github.com/keyval-dev/odigos\">https://github.com/keyval-dev/odigos</a>). Odigos is an open-source project that lets you instantly generate distributed traces for your applications. It works alongside existing monitoring tools and does not require any code changes.<p>Our earlier experiences with monitoring tools were frustrating. Monitoring a distributed system with multiple microservices, we found ourselves spending way too much time trying to locate the specific microservice that was at the root of a problem. For example, we once spent hours debugging an application which we suspected was causing high latency, only to find out that the actual problem was rooted in a completely different application<p>Then we learned about distributed tracing, which solves exactly this problem. As opposed to metrics or logs that capture a data point in time in a single application, a distributed trace follows a request as it propagates through a distributed environment by tagging it with a unique ID. This allows developers to understand the context of each request and how their distributed applications work.<p>The downside is that it is difficult to implement. Unlike metrics or logs, the value of distributed tracing is gained only after implementing it across multiple applications. If even one of your applications does not produce distributed tracing, the context propagation is broken and the value of the traces drops significantly.<p>We manually implemented distributed tracing for multiple companies, but found it a challenge to coordinate all the development teams to instrument their applications in order to achieve a complete distributed trace. Once the implementation was finished, we saw great value and fixed production issues much faster. But partial implementation wasn\u2019t worth much.<p>We set out to find a way to automate this process. We knew how to do most of it, but the trickiest part was how to automatically instrument programs written in compiled languages (like Go). If we could do that, we would be able to automate the entire process of generating distributed traces. While researching, we realized that eBPF\u2014a technology that allows the Linux kernel to load external programs for execution within the kernel\u2014could be used to develop automatic instrumentation for compiled languages. That was the final piece of the puzzle, and with it we were able to develop Odigos.<p>Odigos first scans and recognizes all your running applications, then recognizes the programming language of each one and auto-instruments it accordingly, using eBPF and OpenTelemetry. In addition, it deploys collectors that buffer, filter, and deliver data to your chosen monitoring tool, and auto scales them according to the amount of traffic. This automation allows developers to enjoy distributed traces within minutes as opposed to manual effort which can take months to implement.<p>Automatic instrumentation across programming languages is not a trivial task, especially when dealing with static binaries (like the ones produced by the Go compiler). We built multiple mechanisms to make sure we inject the relevant headers in a secure and stable way. We developed a system that tracks functions and structs across different versions of open-source libraries. In addition, we developed a system that performs userspace memory management in eBPF. As a result, Odigos is the only solution that is able to automatically generate distributed traces for compiled languages like Go and Rust. While other solutions require users to be experts in OpenTelemetry or eBPF, our solution does not require prior knowledge of observability technologies.<p>Our solution can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster by executing a single command. Once installed, we detect the programming language of every running application and apply the relevant instrumentation. For JIT languages (Java and .NET) or interpreted languages (JavaScript and Python) we deploy the OpenTelemetry instrumentation. For compiled languges (Go, Rust, C) we deploy our eBPF-based instrumentation. All of this is abstracted from the user, who only has to: (1) select any or all of the target applications and (2) select a backend to send the monitoring data to.<p>In May 2022, we released our first open-source project: automatic instrumentation for Go applications, based on eBPF. We later donated this project to the OpenTelemetry community and it is currently being developed as part of the Go Automatic Instrumentation SIG.<p>We are big believers in open standards, therefore the instrumentation and collectors used by Odigos are all based on open-source projects developed by the OpenTelemetry community. This also enables us to be vendor-agnostic.<p>Currently we are focused on building our open-source project. There are no pricing or paid features as of yet, but in the future, we are planning to offer a managed version of Odigos that will include enterprise features.<p>If you're interested to learn more, check out our docs (<a href=\"https://docs.odigos.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.odigos.io</a>), watch a demo video (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d36AmVtuGU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d36AmVtuGU</a>), and visit our website (<a href=\"https://odigos.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://odigos.io</a>).<p>We\u2019d love to hear your experiences with tracing and monitoring distributed applications and anything else you\u2019d like to share!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34442603\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34442603</a></p>\n<p>Points: 23</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://github.com/TheMozg/awk-raycaster", "title": "A first person shooter in 571 lines of GNU Awk (2017)", "date_published": "2023-01-19 16:55:10+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/TheMozg/awk-raycaster\">https://github.com/TheMozg/awk-raycaster</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34442528\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34442528</a></p>\n<p>Points: 49</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/n18j5g7wpg0s", "title": "GitHub Pages is currently degraded", "date_published": "2023-01-19 16:44:51+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/n18j5g7wpg0s\">https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/n18j5g7wpg0s</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34442360\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34442360</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 13</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-whatsapp-fined-55-mln-euro-by-lead-eu-privacy-regulator-2023-01-19/", "title": "WhatsApp fined 5.5M euro by lead EU privacy regulator", "date_published": "2023-01-19 16:37:33+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-whatsapp-fined-55-mln-euro-by-lead-eu-privacy-regulator-2023-01-19/\">https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-whatsapp-fined-55-mln-euro-by-lead-eu-privacy-regulator-2023-01-19/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34442228\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34442228</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.propublica.org/article/websites-selling-abortion-pills-share-sensitive-data-with-google", "title": "Online pharmacies selling abortion pills send fingerprints to Google Analytics", "date_published": "2023-01-19 16:24:21+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/websites-selling-abortion-pills-share-sensitive-data-with-google\">https://www.propublica.org/article/websites-selling-abortion-pills-share-sensitive-data-with-google</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34442046\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34442046</a></p>\n<p>Points: 47</p>\n<p># Comments: 43</p>", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34441697", "title": "Tell HN: It is impossible to disable Google 2FA using backup codes", "date_published": "2023-01-19 15:58:32+00:00", "description": "<p>I would like to inform the HN community, if your plan to recover your Google account in the event of losing your phone is to use a 2FA backup code, or SMS recovery, to remove the old 2FA setup and set up a new 2FA code, that that may not be possible.<p>My situation:<p>I had 2FA set up with my Google Account through Google Authenticator.<p>I lost my Google Authenticator settings when I broke my phone.<p>I have 2FA backup codes.  These successfully log me into my Google Account.<p>In order to disable 2FA, or generate new 2FA backup codes, I need to access the 2FA settings page under the Security tab.  When I try to load the Two-factor authentication page, I am forced to re-authenticate with Google.<p>When re-authenticating to access the 2FA page, there is no option to enter a 2FA backup code or SMS verification to pass the 2FA challenge.  The only option under \"Choose a way to verify\" is to enter a 2FA code.  Entering a backup code instead of a 2FA code returns an error.<p>What am I supposed to do in this situation?<p>Yes this is a classic \"maybe I can get support through public shaming\" attempt.

I came across a discussion about a programming question I had from 2013, which isn't uncommon, but to my surprise this place appears to still be thriving a decade later. It calls itself a news site but appears not to be an actual journalist organization, but rather some kind of... archival feed? Is it a social media platform? I've see it compared to Reddit in a couple of the community guidelines and FAQs. What is the purpose and the history of this site, how has it managed to stay up and running for nearly 15 years without me ever hearing about it? For those of you who are still here, why?<p>I must say I'm a bit exited. I find myself mourning the deaths of so many independent forums and smaller social media platforms which thrived tn the 2000s-early 2010's but have now mostly gone offline or faded into complete disuse. I'm not sure exactly what you guys have going on here, but it's seems...
