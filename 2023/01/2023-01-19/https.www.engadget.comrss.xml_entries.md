<p>Epic Games and Match Group now have a court date for their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-match-group-google-motion-213036490.html">antitrust case against Google</a>. A Northern District of California judge has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/19/epic-and-matchs-antitrust-case-against-google-heads-to-jury-trial-on-november-6/">set the start</a> of a jury trial for November 6th. Both Epic and Match accuse Google of abusing its control of Android app distribution through the Play Store by establishing unfair fees and requirements for in-app purchases. This comes alongside a lawsuit from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-suit-211116918.html">39 attorneys general</a> as well as a customer class action suit demanding $4.7 billion in damages.</p><p>Epic sued Google in 2020 after the Android creator <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-android-225437892.html">kicked <em>Fortnite</em> out of the Play Store</a> for letting customers use an alternative in-app payment system. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/match-group-sues-google-225719753.html">Match sued Google</a> last year over the &quot;exorbitant&quot; store fee. Epic and Match consolidated their case and a filed motion last fall to expand their allegations, accusing Google of further antitrust violations by paying major developers hundreds of millions of dollars to keep their apps in the Play Store.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unlike Epic's partially successful lawsuit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">against Apple</a>, this case has to acknowledge that customers do have a choice. Where Apple requires that all regular app downloads go through the App Store, Android's sideloading option lets customers install software without downloading it from Google. The issue, as you might imagine, is that those apps are both harder to install and less likely to be noticed when the Play Store is included by default on many Android phones.</p><p>Google denies misusing its power, and argues that the fees are necessary to maintain and invest in the Play Store. It maintains that the incentive program doesn't forbid developers from launching third-party stores, and that its portal competes fairly. In December, Google called on the court to deny the expanded requests over timing and other issues.</p><p>Google has made some concessions, including a test program for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-user-choice-billing-pilot-us-203330341.html">Play Store billing alternatives</a>. That pilot still gives Google a cut of each transaction, though, and it remains to be seen if moves like that will satisfy the court and regulators. As it is, the internet pioneer is facing a raft of other antitrust cases that include a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-us-justice-department-antitrust-competition-announcement-144344497.html">Justice Department lawsuit</a> from 2020. Even if Google prevails against Epic and Match, it may not escape unscathed.</p>

## Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings steps down as co-CEO

<p>One of streaming's most influential figures is stepping away from the spotlight. Netflix co-creator Reed Hastings is <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/ted-sarandos-greg-peters-co-ceos-netflix">stepping down</a> as the company's co-CEO. Ted Sarandos, who has been co-CEO since July 2020, will share the reins with newly promoted operations chief Greg Peters. The change takes effect today. Hastings says he'll remain involved as Executive Chairman, serving as a &quot;bridge&quot; between the board of directors and the new CEOs.</p><p>The departing leader characterized the move as a long-expected transition. Sarandos and Peters have &quot;increasingly&quot; managed the company for the past two and a half years, Hastings says. This was merely the &quot;right time&quot; to implement a succession that has been in development for years, he adds. Sarandos is credited with leading Netflix's move into original content, while Peters has been key to forming partnerships  and helming the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-aaa-pc-game-new-studio-144526238.html">push into gaming</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Developing...</em></p>

## Twitter’s new developer terms ban third-party clients

<p>In case there was any doubt about Twitter’s intentions in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-third-party-app-developers-api-rules-193013123.html">cutting off</a> the developers of third-party apps, the company has quietly updated its <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement">developer agreement</a> to make clear that app makers are no longer permitted to create their own clients.</p><p>The “restrictions” section of Twitter’s developer agreement was updated Thursday with a clause banning “use or access the Licensed Materials to create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product to the Twitter Applications.” The addition is the only substantive change to the 5,000-word agreement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The change confirms what the makers of many popular Twitter clients have suspected in recent days: that third-party Twitter services are no longer permitted under Elon Musk’s leadership.</p><p>Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1615405842735714304">previously said</a> it was “enforcing long-standing API rules,” but hadn’t cited which rules developers were violating. The company no longer has a communications team, and most staffers working on its developer platform were also cut during the company’s mass layoffs last year.</p><p>But the company's suggestion that the rule was "longstanding" doesn't line up with its history. Twitter clients have long been a part of Twitter. Twitterrific, one of the most prominent apps affected by the API shut-off last week, was created before Twitter had a native iOS app of its own, and is <a href="https://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">credited with</a> coining the word “tweet,” as well as other features now commonly associated with Twitter’s app.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, clients like Tweetbot and Fenix have had devoted followings due to a lack of ads and other features many longtime users dislike. In fact, Twitter explicitly changed its developer policies in 2021 to remove a section that discouraged app makers from "replicating" its core service. The change was part of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-introduces-new-api-third-party-clients-160017423.html">broader shift</a> by Twitter <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8wMi90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3R3aXR0ZXItcGxhdGZvcm0tcmV0aGluay5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMWRhZDU3Mi0wNDBjLTQyMWEtYjI5OS1mYjA3NDMzMzVkZmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATRnOfog56Y3u-LojPurq3kXW4jfjSRPFKv7GFVFBZgQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F03%2F02%2Ftechnology%2Ftwitter-platform-rethink.html">to improve</a> its relationship with developers.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Developing…</em></p>

## World's largest hydrogen-electric aircraft completes 10-minute flight

<p>ZeroAvia flew the world’s largest hydrogen-electric aircraft today in a step forward for sustainable aviation. The 19-seat, twin-engine Dornier 228 plane, fitted with a prototype hydrogen-electric powertrain, completed a 10-minute flight from Cotswold Airport in the UK. It was part of the HyFlyer II project, a government-funded R&amp;D program working to make small passenger planes better for the environment.</p><p>The powertrain was fueled using “compressed gaseous hydrogen produced with an on-site electrolyzer.” The testing configuration included two fuel-cell stacks and lithium-ion battery packs housed in the cabin for the test. However, for commercial use, they would move to external storage to make room for seating. In addition, it was paired with a Honeywell TPE-331 stock engine on the right wing for extra power during takeoff and safety-related redundancy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Here’s ZeroAvia’s promotional footage of the flight (including some delightfully over-the-top music):</p><div id="undefined">&#92;</div><p>ZeroAvia says it’s on track to certify the technology this year, with plans for commercial routes by 2025. The company is also working on a 2-5 MW powertrain program that will scale the technology for aircraft up to 90 seats; the goal is to expand into narrow-body planes in the next decade. In addition, Amazon has invested in the company as part of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-invests-2-billion-clean-energy-fund-183049118.html">Climate Pledge Fund</a>.</p>

Meanwhile, Best Buy is tying pre-order discounts to its TotalTech program, offering a $100 voucher for members buying any of the new laptops (including the 16-inch model). Compared to its 2021 counterpart, the updated MacBook Pro has faster speeds and networking with longer battery life. It launches on February 24th.</p><p></p><p>Amazon’s sale only covers the entry-level (512GB, M2 Pro) 14-inch MacBook Pro in Space Gray.

## 'Birth' is the macabre indie game quietly crushing the convention circuit

<p>Madison Karrh’s booth at Summer Game Fest 2022 was on the far right side of the demo area, hugging a wall at the front of the small industrial space in downtown Los Angeles. Her game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1889040/Birth/"><em>Birth</em></a>, was one of the first projects you’d see after grabbing a swag bag, but it was easy to overlook in a sea of neon pixels and mainstream names like Street Fighter, Cuphead and Sonic. <em>Birth</em> is a thoughtful game of bones, puzzles, loneliness and decay, rendered in earth tones and captivating, hand-drawn vignettes. In a Day of the Devs cluster at Summer Game Fest, the <em>Birth </em>booth was a bubble of respite from the fast action showcased on surrounding screens.</p><p>“Showing <em>Birth </em>at conventions feels like putting my whole, raw, beating heart on a table in front of a bunch of strangers and asking if it is enough for them,” Karrh told me a few months after Summer Game Fest.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Summer Game Fest 2022" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/93d36fa0-969e-11ed-9efb-f7d481d68a81" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p><em>Birth </em>is, essentially, a game about death. It’s an introspective experience with an entire city block to explore and small surprises in every scene, and it invites people to play with their deepest insecurities. Physics and logic puzzles are hidden in cafes, apartments and bookstores, each one welcoming players to engage with thoughts of mortality and loneliness. Build your own companion out of scattered bones and organs, peel back bandages to remove foreign objects from human limbs, interact with skeleton creatures, let your mind wander while organizing eyeballs, poke at all manner of decaying animal carcasses.</p><p>Nothing about <em>Birth </em>is harsh; from color palette to gameplay, this is an experience built for slow afternoons and sleepless nights. Even in the middle of a busy game convention, it’s a soothing way to play with terrifying topics.</p><div id="ab596efa43ec44da851ac3c36ef3451e"></div><p>“As humans, we know that we will die,” Karrh said. “Yet there is so much joy and art and love that gets created regardless of this looming fact. Maybe even because of it. I think about the limitations of mortality every day, and I want my portrayal of death and decay and loneliness to be as soft and gentle and genuine as possible.”</p><p>Half a year after Summer Game Fest, I still can’t get <em>Birth</em> off my mind. The themes are heavy, but the game is not, and this balance is a testament to Karrh’s eye for design and visual appeal. When it comes out on February 17th, <em>Birth </em>will be her third release on Steam, and her largest project to date.</p><p>“Day-to-day loneliness can be an embarrassing thing to admit to feeling,” Karrh said. “I hope the tender art style and the silly physics of the game make it feel more like having a contemplative, clumsy conversation with a friend.”</p><figure><img alt="Birth" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/09c29660-969e-11ed-8ffd-6d881c854fdd" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Madison Karrh</div></figure><p>After Summer Game Fest, Karrh took <em>Birth </em>to Cologne, Germany, for Gamescom, the largest video game convention of the year. There, it was one of 130 games in the Indie Arena, sandwiched between sprawling adventures, city builders, sci-fi combat and metal music. Thousands of people streamed past her booth, some stopping to play for a few minutes and others lingering for an hour. Karrh never rushed players through their time with <em>Birth</em>, even though it meant fewer people ultimately got their hands on it.</p><p>“I was just so honored and smitten with the fact that people chose to spend so much of their time with my game in a sea of other delicious games,” Karrh said. “<em>Birth</em> doesn't appeal to everyone, of course – I think the minimal, dark art style of my booth filtered out the humans who wouldn't be interested. It is a slow, intimate game and I didn't want anyone to feel rushed. People waited in line, people brought their friends back to show it to them. It felt like everyone was giving me a big giant hug.”</p><p>After Gamescom, <em>Birth </em>made its way to San Francisco for the Day of the Devs showcase in November. This was its fourth convention appearance of the year, adding a trip to London for WASD in April. <em>Birth </em>is a small game that’s been on a worldwide tour, and in the process it’s plucked Karrh out of her own isolated game-development hole. Even after <em>Birth </em>comes out – and even though it’s a single-player game that’ll likely be consumed by people sitting alone in dark rooms – this game represents true human connection for Karrh.</p><section><img alt="Birth" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/55cc3980-969e-11ed-adff-af46576ddd87" /></section><p>“I have lived most of my twenties in tiny studio apartments surrounded by other tiny studio apartments full of strangers,” she said. “As a solo game dev, I spend a lot of time sitting alone at my desk. It took me a very long time to accept that if I wanted to create as many games as I could, that I would need to spend a huge chunk of my life alone. I used to worry that I was wasting my life making games, and that I should be running around the city and kissing humans and falling in love. Fortunately, I have grown out of this insecurity and I think I have connected on a deep level with humans through making games.”</p><p>In the end, <em>Birth </em>is designed to be played solo, but it’s a game about the most universal shared experiences that humans have. In this sense, it’s impossible to truly play <em>Birth </em>alone.</p><p>“Loneliness is, oddly enough, a shared feeling,” Karrh said.</p>

## UK bill would ban videos portraying Channel immigrant crossings in a 'positive light'

<p>The UK government is still expanding the scope of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deepfake-porn-uk-ban-online-safety-bill-171007700.html">Online Safety Bill</a>. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport secretary Michelle Donelan said in a <a href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2023-01-17/hcws500">statement</a> that politicians will propose amending the bill to ban videos portraying Channel immigrant crossings by boat in a &quot;positive light.&quot; Those clips are &quot;aiding [and] abetting&quot; immigration law violations, according to Donelan. As with child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and terrorist content, internet platforms will have to pull crossing-related footage quickly.</p><p>The culture secretary detailed other significant proposed amendments. Senior company leaders could face prison time if they've &quot;consented or connived&quot; to ignore online child safety requirements. Platforms will also have to remove content that promotes LGBTQ conversion therapy practices. Violations of any aspect of the bill could lead to fines up to £18 million (about $22.3 million) or 10 percent of a company's global turnover.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The amendments should be ready for a version of the bill reaching the House of Lords. The changes came after pressure from Conservative MPs like Natalie Elphicke, who serves Dover — a frequent landing site for illegal immigrants.</p><p>The alterations aren't surprising given growing concerns in the country over the impact of illegal immigration, not to mention existing provisions in the bill for child safety. However, they add to the feature creep of a bill that has already been delayed several times. There have been concerns the Online Safety Bill might not pass before the next general election, due within two years.</p><p>The new provisions also won't satisfy critics like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which already claim the measure amounts to censorship. They're worried the bill will also hurt privacy by eroding protections for the use of end-to-end encryption. Whatever your stances on the issues, it's safe to say the changes would further limit what UK residents are allowed to say online.</p>

<p>Some cars seem oddly well-suited to Uber (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-2023-prius-064547980.html">Toyota Prius</a>, anyone?), but the company is now taking things a step further. Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3ViZXItd29ya2luZy13aXRoLWF1dG8tbWFrZXJzLXRvLWRlc2lnbi12ZWhpY2xlcy1jdXN0b21pemVkLWZvci1yaWRlLXNoYXJpbmctZGVsaXZlcnktMTE2NzQxMzI3OTY_bW9kPWhwX2xlYWRfcG9zNSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWRlNjYwZmYtMzZjMS00NGMyLWI4MjYtYTAxZjExNWEwNTIyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXcYDkQMYufhAXYD4BbDQ_M8g7QCf0345y5Ojg_Q2nBp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fuber-working-with-auto-makers-to-design-vehicles-customized-for-ride-sharing-delivery-11674132796%3Fmod%3Dhp_lead_pos5">told guests</a> at a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> event that his firm is now teaming up with car manufacturers to design EVs with ridesharing and deliveries in mind. Rideshare cars will ideally have lower top speeds to reduce costs, as well as passenger seats that face each other to promote conversations. Delivery vehicles, meanwhile, might have two or three wheels (to help navigate city streets) but loads of trunk space.</p><p>Khosrowshahi didn't say which automakers were involved, or provide a timeline for when optimized EVs might be ready. Uber said in 2021 that it was partnering with Arrival on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-arrival-custom-ev-taxis-094528261.html">custom electric taxis</a>, but that was before the startup <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ev-startup-arrival-to-refocus-business-on-electric-vans-for-the-us-market-183335281.html">scrapped its automotive projects</a> in favor of vans.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Uber is no stranger to promoting electrified rides. The company launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-green-us-climate-change-impact-162446386.html">Uber Green</a> years ago, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-green-earth-day-151017601.html">lowered prices</a> last spring. More recently, it expanded the option of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-now-offers-ev-rides-in-25-cities-124542727.html">hailing all-electric rides</a> to two dozen US cities. The company has also made EVs more accessible to some drivers by making <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-rents-tesla-evs-to-drivers-131556170.html">Tesla</a> and Polestar cars available to rent through a deal with Hertz. This latest effort could further widen access by lowering the price of entry and speeding up deliveries.</p><p>The service is under pressure to transition to EVs quickly. Internally, it plans to go pure-electric in some regions by 2030, and in cities like London by 2025. Governments in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-member-countries-agree-ban-sale-of-gas-powered-cars-2035-140035763.html">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-04-uk-ban-petrol-diesel-hybrid-cars-2035.html">the UK</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ny-joins-ca-in-making-all-auto-sales-either-hybrid-or-ev-by-2035-075733173.html">North America</a> will also ban sales of combustion engine cars as early as 2035. The more drivers willingly adopt EVs, the fewer headaches Uber is likely to encounter in the years ahead.</p>

## Ubisoft cancels team battle game 'Project Q'

<p>Ubisoft has identified one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-skull-and-bones-delay-games-canceled-202818759.html">three games it cancelled</a> last week. A spokesperson for the publisher has confirmed to Engadget and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-project-q-cancelled"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> that it will &quot;no longer support the development&quot; of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-project-q-announced-205040384.html"><em>Project Q</em></a>, the team battle arena title it revealed last April. The move will help the company concentrate on &quot;priority projects,&quot; according to the representative. Ubisoft is reassigning team members to games still in development.</p><p>Developers shared little about <em>Project Q</em>. Besides concept art, Ubisoft only said the game was &quot;not a battle royale&quot; and would have a range of player-versus-player modes. It added that there were no plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-nft-executive-response-155250977.html">offer NFTs</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The firm still hasn't named the two other cancelled games. The reasoning, however, is the same. Ubisoft expects its revenue to drop year-over-year due to a rough economy, delayed releases and shifting game trends, and notes that holiday offerings like <em>Just Dance 2023</em> and <em>Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</em> didn't sell as well as expected. Management is looking to shave expenses wherever it can, and fewer games is clearly part of that strategy alongside &quot;targeted restructuring&quot; that could include layoffs.</p><p>The year has already been problematic. A labor union <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-paris-strike-183059140.html">called for a strike</a> at Ubisoft Paris after CEO Yves Guillemot made statements suggesting rank-and-file staff, not leadership, had to be &quot;especially careful&quot; with money. <em>Kotaku</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassin-s-creed-mirage-far-cry-delay-canceled-1850001343">claims</a> Guillemot offered a partial apology in a follow-up meeting. However, the incident apparently underscored the rift between management and employees — one that may not be mended in the near future.</p>

## NVIDIA GeForce Now Ultimate hands-on: The enthusiast's choice for cloud gaming

<p>This week, as the lights go out for good <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-stadia-162704135.html">at one major game streaming service</a>, NVIDIA is upgrading GeForce Now with a bunch of features thanks to the addition of new <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/01/05/geforce-now-thursday-jan-5/">SuperPODs equipped with RTX 4080 GPUs</a>. And after testing out some of the service’s improved capabilities, the addition of expanded support for high refresh rates and ultrawide resolutions is really turning GeForce Now into a truly high-end cloud gaming app.</p><p>For those that missed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-now-ultimate-rtx-4080-announced-175244712.html">initial announcement</a> back at CES, GeForce Now’s recently renamed Ultimate plan (formerly the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-now-introduces-an-rtx-3080-tier-for-up-to-1440-p-120-fps-gaming-130011568.html">RTX 3080 tier</a>) is getting a number of new features including support for refresh rates of up to 240Hz at full HD or 4K at 120 fps and an expanded set of usable wide-screen resolutions (3840x1600, 3440x1440 and 2560x1080). On top of that NVIDIA is also adding better support for HDR on both Macs and PCs along with the ability to use full ray tracing with DLSS3 in supported games. Right away, this elevates GeForce Now above rivals like Xbox Cloud Gaming, which is capped at 1080p/60fps. But in practice, the service’s new features have an even bigger impact as they make it easier to get the most out of a wider range of games and gaming setups.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Take for example my current gaming PC, which is centered around an aging RTX 2080 card (GPUs ain’t cheap y’all) and a 4K/120Hz display. In more recent AAA games, my graphics card simply doesn’t have enough oomph to hit 120 fps at higher graphics settings, which means I always have to fiddle around a bit before I get a game’s performance dialed in just right. But with the new resolution support in GeForce Now Ultimate, suddenly I can play a game with all the bells and whistles turned on while still taking full advantage of my monitor’s specs.</p><figure><img alt="With this much stuff happening on screen, you need all the performance you can get. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/137a5f50-9778-11ed-bfef-15263f6fceea" /><figcaption>With this much stuff happening on screen, you need all the performance you can get. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>This effect was most evident when I played the demo <em>Ghostrunner, </em>which is a fast-paced first-person slasher set in a dystopian future. It’s exactly the kind of game where you need fast reactions to dodge bullets while slicing apart your enemies. Unfortunately, at least on my desktop, in order to hit 120 fps, I had lower things like texture settings and anti-aliasing, which meant I couldn’t fully enjoy the game’s gorgeous cyberpunk aesthetic. But that wasn’t an issue in GeForce Now, where I was able to max out the graphics and still hit 120 fps. And even though I ignored NVIDIA’s directions and was connected to the internet over Wi-Fi, gameplay was so crisp and responsive that after just a few minutes, I completely forgot I was relying on servers in the cloud instead of the PC next to my feet.</p><p>While I don’t have the equipment at home to test it out properly, the addition of NVIDIA’s Competitive Mode toggle in GeForce Now gives you more freedom to hit really high refresh rates (up to 240Hz at 1080p) regardless of how fast (or slow) your PC might be. And while I was only able to go up to 120 fps on my monitor while playing <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>, I only encountered a single stutter over the course of multiple matches, which would be impressive even if I was relying on local hardware, let alone a server hundreds of miles away. And when you factor in that the service also works with the company’s <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5udmlkaWEuY29tL2VuLXVzL2dlZm9yY2UvbmV3cy9yZWZsZXgtbG93LWxhdGVuY3ktcGxhdGZvcm0vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkOTdhYjJjMy1jMWFmLTRhOTMtOGYwMy0zZTNhYTIxYzg4M2UifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAarN92y7w-fUjbfnmT8wQXa8zUeVkcv9ZTioD2zt5UqZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Freflex-low-latency-platform%2F">Reflex</a> tech to reduce latency, the whole experience was shockingly smooth.</p><figure><img alt="Hitting CTRL + N in the GeForce Now app lets you see what type of server is powering your game along with stats like network info and streaming settings. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/47f32460-9778-11ed-9f31-05a9b1706a18" /><figcaption>Hitting CTRL + N in the GeForce Now app lets you see what type of server is powering your game along with stats like network info and streaming settings. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Now there are some important caveats. The first is that you need a speedy internet connection. NVIDIA’s recommended minimum bandwidth for gaming at 1080p at 240 fps is 35 Mbps. If you’re like me and you want to max out at 4K/120 fps, you’ll need at least a 45 Mbps connection, not to mention additional overhead to handle anyone else who might be using the internet at your home. This also means that while the idea of gaming at 4K on the road sounds awesome, you’ll still be at the whims of your hotel or Airbnb’s network, which typically aren’t very speedy or reliable.</p><p>The other main thing to think about is that after the new Ultimate tier goes live today (January 19th), at least initially, the availability of the new SuperPODs may be limited. At launch, new servers with 4080 GPUs will be located in four places: San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas and Frankfurt Germany. That means only people in the U.S. and Central Europe will have access to GeForce Now’s Ultimate tier, and even then, if there are too many people online, you may get downgraded to a server still equipped with 3080 cards. (Tip: if you are using GeForce Now and want to see what hardware your cloud games are running on, you can hit CTRL + N to see stats including your server type, network specs and more).</p><figure><img alt="Even with the addition of servers RTX 4080 GPUs, NVIDIA's top-tier Ultimate plan will remain the same price at $20 a month. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/b054f1a0-9778-11ed-beff-29e728fe4a40" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA</div></figure><p>The final hurdle is that at $20 a month compared to $12 for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (which includes cloud streaming), GeForce Now UItimate is a bit on the pricey side. But as the old saying goes: you get what you pay for. And for an extra $8 a month, NVIDIA’s latest update to its game streaming services delivers better performance, more control over your resolution and refresh rate, and support for fancy features like ray tracing and Reflex. Granted, it’s a bit weird to think about specs for hardware you don’t really own, but for people who want their games to look as good as possible regardless of what hardware they’re playing, GeForce Now’s new Ultimate tier is positioning itself as the enthusiast’s choice for cloud gaming.</p>

<p>Instagram is introducing a handful of features designed to give users more control over the app, starting with a new Quiet Mode. The tool functions a lot like your phone’s Do Not Disturb setting. When active, Instagram won’t push notifications to your device. Your profile will also display a note that you’re “in quiet mode,” and anyone who attempts to message you will receive an automatic reply that you’re not available.</p><p>You can set Quiet Mode to activate automatically at certain times of day. Once you’re outside those hours, Instagram will send you a summary of your notifications. Anyone can use Quiet Mode, but the company says it will prompt teens to use the feature if it notices they’re spending a lot of time scrolling through their feed late at night. Quiet Mode is available starting today in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Instagram Quiet Mode" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/71611020-97fd-11ed-bef3-c04b63cf7a2a" style="height: 2988; width: 4239;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Instagram</div></figure><p>Alongside the new mode, Instagram is introducing a handful of features designed to give people more control over the photos and videos they see on the platform. Specifically, you can now tell the app the types of content you don’t want to be recommended to you. Starting with the Explore tab, you can select multiple tiles and tap “Not Interested” to shape Instagram’s content algorithm. Doing so will also affect what you see when you search for posts. Additionally, in an expansion of a feature that was already available for comments and direct messages, you can list specific words, hashtags and emoji you want Instagram to filter for when recommending content. You can access that tool through the “Hidden Words” section of the app's privacy settings. One limitation is that filters will only work when the app detects the words you listed in hashtags and captions. Lastly, Instagram notes it recently added a feature that allows parents to see their teen’s app settings.</p><p>The subject of inappropriate recommendations came up during <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-hearing-instagram-adam-mosseri-001751448.html"><ins>Adam Mosseri’s congressional hearing in 2021</ins></a>. Members of the Senate subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Data Security grilled the head of Instagram about the content they saw the app steer them toward after creating fresh Instagram accounts designed to impersonate teens. Specifically, Utah Senator Mike Lee said he saw the Explore page of his finsta account change dramatically after following a single account recommended by Instagram. According to Lee, the app began recommending posts promoting body dysmorphia, sexualization of women and other content inappropriate for teen girls. “It went dark fast,” he said.</p><p>Whether the changes Instagram is introducing today will sufficiently address the concerns raised by lawmakers is hard to say, as Instagram is putting the onus on teen users to filter their feeds instead of doing that work itself.</p>

## Samsung’s display injunction leaves repair technicians worried

<p>Samsung may have found a way to strike a hefty blow to the United States’ burgeoning <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-always-on-display-brightness-screen-replacement-issue-130035505.html">right to repair</a> movement. It has approached the International Trade Commission (ITC), requesting an investigation into the importation of third-party OLED displays for independent repair stores. And if the ITC finds in Samsung’s favor it would, in the words of Louis Rossmann (who <a href="https://pdfhost.io/v/POwuAEK21_lawsuit">published the text</a> of the complaint), “fire a kill shot on the entire repair industry.”</p><p>Put simply, Samsung’s claim says that it creates AMOLED displays for mobile devices, and that those displays are covered by a number of patents. But factories in China (and elsewhere) are, according to Samsung, churning out similar screens that infringe upon those patents. And that these screens are often imported by third-party repair businesses in the US as a cheaper option than buying authorized parts directly from, in this case, Samsung.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Several businesses are named in Samsung’s complaint, including <a href="https://www.mobilesentrix.com/">MobileSentrix</a>, <a href="https://www.injuredgadgets.com/">Injured Gadgets</a> and <a href="https://cellphoneandparts.com/">DFW Cellphone &amp; Parts</a>. Many offer wholesale parts and equipment to other repair companies, as well as their own over-the-counter repair service. Samsung wants the ITC to issue orders blocking the importation of these replacement display parts at the border. It has also requested that the named companies be ordered to stop importing, selling or using the products in question.</p><p>Now, Samsung is well within its right to protect its intellectual property, even if it’s going about it in a very interesting way. Rather than address the violating factories directly by seeking remedy where those businesses operate, it’s opting instead to block imports into the US. Given the cavalier manner that foreign IP is treated in some parts of the world, it may be easier to go after the customer than it is to attack the suppliers. Samsung’s lawyers did not respond to our requests for comment at the time of publication.</p><p>On January 4th, 2023, the ITC announced that it would open an investigation into the import activity under <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/intellectual_property/about_section_337.htm">section 337 of the Tariff Act (1930)</a>. This gives the ITC broad latitude to look into if the act of importing a product into the US would harm a business operating here. That includes both the infringement of registered patents, as well as the “misappropriation of trade secrets.” And the remedies on offer include the prohibition on further imports as well as the blanket ban on further attempts to acquire this hardware.</p><p>The ITC has become a useful tool in corporate America’s arsenal when looking to avoid a drawn-out courtroom battle. Law firm Meyer Brown’s <a href="https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/capabilities/practices/intellectual-property/itc-section-337-actions?tab=overview">report on section 337</a> explains that companies use Commission because it offers a “highly accelerated procedure” and “powerful remedies” which are “not available in federal courts.”</p><p>If Samsung’s request is successful, it could prevent large volumes of third-party OLED displays from being imported to the US. This would have consequences for the small and medium-sized repair businesses that have grown up around repairing broken smartphone screens. It would also funnel significantly more people toward Samsung’s network of authorized service centers.</p><p>Few individuals are willing to speak on the record concerning the present state of Android device repair for fear of souring already-strained supplier relationships. We heard from multiple sources that the perpetually under-fire third-party Apple repair ecosystem is luxurious compared to its Android equivalent. One individual, who asked not to be named, said it was often difficult to source replacement parts for Android handsets, which regularly cost more than those for equivalent Apple products.</p><p>Another said that standalone Android repair businesses often struggle to stay afloat since they have to charge higher prices for display replacement. And many customers, when shown the potential cost, prefer to ditch their device in favor of replacing it outright. (We noted, too, that on Samsung’s <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc3VwcG9ydC9jcmFja2VkLXNjcmVlbi1yZXBhaXIvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxYzhlNzI5Mi05ODc1LTQ2MTQtYmYwMC02MzM5NmNiY2MwYWQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdC7VtZd01HtCV_WSO3zO2KO3M7h3LSCjl7c_mZ-7Vtp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fcracked-screen-repair%2F">US cracked display support page</a>, the first option in the list is to upgrade your phone rather than opting for a screen replacement.)</p><p>In its case to the ITC, Samsung says that it has “sufficient manufacturing capacity” to “assure demand is met for OLED displays as replacement,” which are “supplied through authorized channels.” We could not contact anyone inside Samsung’s authorized repair channels for comment, but one independent repairer who claimed knowledge of the situation said that wasn’t necessarily the case. They believe that Samsung repairers often face long wait times for replacement parts, and that the company often can’t fulfill demand quickly enough.</p><p>The Repair Association and US Public Interest Research Group issued a joint submission to the ITC on January 12th, which was shared with Engadget. It said Samsung was behaving in a manner contrary to the US’ present push to reduce the proliferation of e-waste. They added the move was likely anti-competitive and designed to box out independent repair technicians. And that, if Samsung is concerned about patent infringement, it should seek to negotiate with the infringing factories directly or propose “fair and reasonable” licensing terms.</p><p>When contacted, the ITC said that it did not comment on ongoing matters, and it will likely be some time before we learn its decision. Rossmann, in a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PUEwMDJBZXNWYUZrJnQ9MjM1cyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWM4ZTcyOTItOTg3NS00NjE0LWJmMDAtNjMzOTZjYmNjMGFkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARSNdT2uQN3Bft9kkHzEXT9VfD24l2x2AhewzJpbAKNv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DA002AesVaFk%26t%3D235s">YouTube video</a> posted to his channel, added that this may not just affect Samsung displays, but also any OLED display supplied by Samsung. Which includes a number of displays for iOS devices, given that Samsung Display <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/11/23/samsung-largest-supplier-oled-iphone-14/#:~:text=Samsung%20leads%20OLED%20display%20supply%20to%20Apple&amp;text=Samsung%20has%20a%20clear%20advantage,for%20every%20iPhone%2014%20model.">reportedly supplies 70 percent</a> of all screens for iPhones. Which means that, if the ITC interprets this in the broadest possible terms, the right to repair movement may be in for a long battle.</p>

## The Morning After: Apple's HomePod returns with new smart home features

<p>Apple discontinued its original HomePod smart speaker a few years ago. Now, we have a sequel. The company has resurrected the bigger unit with upgraded audio, a more powerful chip, more smart home abilities and, importantly, a lower price. The overall design, however, is mostly unchanged. Some will think it’s still a little pricey at $299, however.</p><p>The HomePod has room-sensing tech, so it can read sound reflections to determine its position (near a wall or in free space) and adjust the audio in real-time. There’s also Spatial Audio support. But the most interesting updates are its smart home tools. First, a feature called Sound Recognition can monitor for smoke and carbon monoxide alarms and send an alert to your iPhone if it hears one. This tool will be available in a software update &quot;later this spring.&quot; Since the new smart home standard Matter is (almost) everywhere, the 2023 HomePod can connect to and control gadgets compatible with it. Apple added that any smart home communications are end-to-end encrypted by default, and the company can't read them.</p><p>The new HomePod is <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3Nob3AvYnV5LWhvbWVwb2QvaG9tZXBvZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2NkZjgxMGItZmE5Zi00YWYwLWFkMmQtZDU0ODU5ODllMmE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQk8xEuRqdhI_8XkDuvIkFTuJrz4TbwBJpssNYD57_SS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-homepod%2Fhomepod&amp;uuid=ChngyrXaZWeRfVxI1686"><ins>available for pre-order now</ins></a> and ships February 3rd.

## Twitter's Blue subscription comes to Android devices

<p>Twitter Blue has arrived on Android, and just like on iOS, it will cost you $11 a month to pay for a subscription through Google Play. The social media website has <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue">updated</a> its About page for Blue to add Android pricing for all the countries where the service is currently available, namely the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>Before this, you'd have to pay for a subscription via the web or an iOS device if you want to enjoy Blue's perks on an Android phone. Take note, however, that paying through Google will cost you $3 more than paying through a web browser. By charging more when you pay via your device's app store, Twitter is essentially passing the tech giants' 30 percent commission onto you. If you don't mind firing up a web browser to pay for Twitter Blue, you can score a year-long subscription for $84 per year, no matter what your phone's operating system is. It's a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-now-offering-a-yearly-discount-rate-on-blue-verified-checkmarks-115514908.html">newly launched option</a> that's equivalent to paying $7 a month instead of $8.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Twitter Blue subscription will put a blue checkmark next to your name on the website and will give you access to features not yet available for non-paying users. One of those features lets you preview your tweet and gives you the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-edit-button-131527359.html">option to &quot;undo&quot; it</a> before it gets posted on your timeline. You also get access to bookmark folders, themes and custom app icons. But as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/18/twitter-blue-is-now-available-on-android-at-the-same-price-as-ios/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> notes, there's no telling what Blue's feature list will look like over the coming months: The company could very well add new perks or remove them in the future. The checkmark will likely remain as one of the service's main selling points, however, seeing as Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587498907336118274">previously called</a> Twitter's &quot;lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn't have a blue checkmark&quot; as &quot;bullshit.&quot;</p>

## Apple may release an ‘iPad-based’ smart home device to compete with Nest Hub and Echo Show

<p>Apple is reportedly working on an iPad-like smart home device designed to compete against Amazon's Echo Show and Google's Nest Hub products, according to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/18/apple-smart-home-display-apple-tv-speaker/"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. It would reportedly be "essentially a low-end iPad" that would operate as a hub to control thermostats, lights and security systems, while also allowing FaceTime chats. It could be mounted on walls using magnetic clips or positioned more as a home hub-type device than a regular iPad.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has also discussed the idea of building smart home displays larger than iPads, though there are no other details on those. None of the smart home products would be ready until 2024 at earliest.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rumors about potential Apple smart displays have popped up before. Last August, it was reported that the company had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-smart-home-devices-report-155130684.html">four smart home devices</a> in its labs, including a kitchen accessory that combined an iPad with a speaker.

<p>Amazon plans to wind down AmazonSmile, its giving program that allows buyers to donate to their favorite charities with every purchase, by February 20th, 2023. In its <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-closing-amazonsmile-to-focus-its-philanthropic-giving-to-programs-with-greater-impact">announcement</a>, the e-commerce giant said "the program has not grown to create the impact that [it] had originally hoped" almost a decade after it was launched. Apparently, the program's ability to make meaningful impact was hampered by the fact that it has over 1 million eligible organizations worldwide. Donations were often spread too thin.&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever people use the AmazonSmile website to make a purchase, the company donates 0.5 percent of what they paid to the charity of their choice at no additional cost to them. As a parting donation to participating organizations, Amazon will give them the equivalent of three months what they earned in 2022 through the program. Going forward, the company will focus its charitable work "in other areas where it can make meaningful change." It gave a few examples of its future plans, such as investing $2 billion to build and preserve affordable housing, funding the computer science curriculum for 1 million students across thousands of schools and delivering 12 million meals this year through food banks.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon didn't expound on what it meant by the program failing to make a meaningful impact. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-19/amazon-kills-smile-charity-program-to-focus-on-other-giving?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> through, the company donated almost $500 million to charities over the past 10 years through AmazonSmile, but the average amount per donation is only $230 due to the sheer number of participating organizations. Still, <a href="https://twitter.com/deverbovitae/status/1615940045307023361">critics</a> can't help but wonder if this is merely one of Amazon's <a href="https://twitter.com/KelliAgodon/status/1615943511211401217">cost-cutting tactics</a>.</p><p>If you'll recall, Amazon recently announced that it's expanding its planned job cuts to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html">eliminate over 18,000 roles</a>. Amazon was one of the companies that benefited from COVID lockdowns over the past few years and had to hire thousands of new people to keep up with the demand. Consumers eventually went back to their pre-pandemic shopping habits, and Amazon (with its bottomline affected by the shift) reportedly <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2FtYXpvbi10by1sYXktb2ZmLW92ZXItMTctMDAwLXdvcmtlcnMtbW9yZS10aGFuLWZpcnN0LXBsYW5uZWQtMTE2NzI4NzQzMDQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUyYzNjYzRjLWJlMjctNGRjNS04MTFkLTJlNTNhMTQzNGQ2ZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcRgAjUWlUzgawMRp38KSGvqMkNqolFi5Isr2V4fcjVq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Famazon-to-lay-off-over-17-000-workers-more-than-first-planned-11672874304">conducted cost-cutting reviews</a> to figure out which units weren't bringing in money. As a result, Amazon froze hiring, closed brick-and-mortar stores and shut down business units, in addition to cutting jobs.&nbsp;</p>
