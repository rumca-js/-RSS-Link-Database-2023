On 1/12 when I tried to make one I had a little over\ntwo weeks (17d) before expiration.  I should have left a larger\ncushion, but the RMV says you </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/ask-the-rmv\">generally need\n14d</a> and it averaged \n\n<a href=\"https://www.massdottracker.com/wp/divisions/rmv/rmv-customer-experience/\">9d\nin 2021 and 11d in 2022</a>.  The earliest appointment at the Boston\nRMV was 2/23 (42d).\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI filled out their <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/forms/rmv-customer-contact-us\">contact\nform</a> asking if I could get an extension, and they replied:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nExtensions are only granted during an in person renewal\nappointment, we cannot offer an extension through email. As a reminder\nrenewal is available up to a full year in advance and up to 2 years\nafter expiration.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThis morning I tried going in person right when they opened.  Outside\nthey checked whether you had an appointment, and wouldn't let you in\nfor an ID without one:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\nMe: I tried to renew my license a few weeks in advance and the soonest\nappointment it would offer me was nearly a month after it expires.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nRMV: Sorry, you need an appointment.  Try reloading the page to\nsee if there's a cancellation.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nMe: I've been doing that, and the earliest it shows me is March.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nRMV: That's not possible.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nMe: Here's what I see:\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/renew-license-first-option-march-big.jpg\"><img border=\"1\" class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"735\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/renew-license-first-option-march.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nRMV: Sorry, still you need an appointment.  Try reloading the page\nevery hour to see if there's a cancellation.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWhen you go to check if there have been any cancellations you're\npresented with a screen like:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ma-rmv-locations-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ma-rmv-locations.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere are 17 RMV locations within an hour drive of my house, and the\nonly way to check for cancellations is to manually click each one.  I\ncan't ask it to order locations by \"soonest available appointment\" or\neven \"closest to my house\".  Checking all 17 right now, the soonest\noption is 2/14 (26d) in Taunton.  This is 43mi away and would be a\n55min drive, except it's after my license expires so it would be a\n2hr+ each way on public transit.  Everything within an hour on public\ntransit is 3/2 (42d).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis is similar to what WBZ reported <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/massachusetts-rmv-long-wait-times-employee-shortage/\">in\nNovember</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nWhen WBZ checked for appointments online, a \"no appointments\navailable\" screen popped up for RMV offices in Boston, Attleboro,\nLowell, Worcester and all points between. One turned up in Greenfield\nfour weeks out, which would take almost two hours to get to.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI'm not sure what I'll do about my renewal except keep checking back,\nbut if you need an appointment I'd recommend scheduling it well in\nadvance!\n\n  </p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Jeff Kaufmann"}}
