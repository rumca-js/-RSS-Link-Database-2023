Alinejad recounts her personal experiences growing up in Iran, being exiled, and multiple kidnapping attempts orchestrated by the current regime.\n\nMasih Alinejad is an Iranian-American journalist, author, and women's rights activist. Alinejad is an outspoken critic of the Iranian government\u2019s human rights abuses and its treatment of women and political opponents. She is the founder of the My Stealthy Freedom campaign against compulsory hijab. Since its launch in 2014 has become the largest civil disobedience campaign for women\u2019s rights in the history of the Islamic Republic. Alinejad currently lives in exile in New York City under FBI protection since a coordinated kidnapping attempt by the Islamic Republic of Iran's Intelligence Ministry was foiled in 2021. \n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBlack Rifle Coffee:  Get 10% off your first order or Coffee Club subscription with code JORDAN: https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Masih Alinejad:\n\n(Book) The Wind in My Hair by Masih Alinejad\n\"The Next Revolution Will be Led by Women\" Speech by Masih Alinejad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX1-kT1jQZk \n\n\u201cMy Stealthy Freedom\u201d campaign against compulsory hijab in Iran by Masih Alinejad: https://www.mystealthyfreedom.org/# \n\n\u201cThe West is finally waking up to the real problem in Iran\u201d oped by Masih Alinejad: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/27/masih-alinejad-iran-human-rights-macron-west/ \n\n\u201cThe Beginning of the End of the Islamic Republic, Iranians Have Had Enough of Theocracy,\u201d Article by Masih Alinejad: https://www.foreignaffairs.com/iran/beginning-end-islamic-republic-iranians-theocracy?utm_medium=promo_email&amp;utm_source=lo_flows&amp;utm_campaign=registered_user_welcome&amp;utm_term=email_1&amp;utm_content=20221224 \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:18) Intro\n(3:13) Brave or foolhardy?\n(6:30) Women in Iran, the loss of social freedom\n(9:55) 1979, all who were affected\n(12:00) Ebrahim Raisi, the butcher of Iran\n(15:15) Religious dictatorship\n(18:00) Compulsory Hijab is a symbol of oppression \n(19:35) Men and women, the optimal relationship\n(22:47) Crime of womanhood, insult to manhood\n(25:47) Pamphlets, Parliament, and exile\n(29:22) Kidnapping plot, fear and bravery\n(34:00) Facing the West, Islamophobia\n(39:00) The women\u2019s march, a need to go further\n(44:00) Balancing relations with Islam and Islamic countries\n(49:00) The need for universal values\n(51:36) Execution, protest at a funeral\n(54:24) The desert, chaos, collapse\n(55:30) Why Iran can survive revolution\n(59:55) Lies of the current regime, broken mentality\n(1:02:00) Mahsa Amini, the dress code of Sharia Law\n(1:05:50) Masih\u2019s family was weaponized against her\n(1:10:15) Corruption of the Mullahs\n(1:12:55) Assassination plot, motive, and spin\n(1:14:40) Salman Rushdie, western apologists\n(1:17:55) Message to Trudeau from Iran\n(1:22:35) The scale of protest in Iran\n(1:28:00) New age in Iran, the call for heroes\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #dailywireplus \n\n#Iran #Revolution #WomensMarch", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}], "source": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "title": "Jordan B Peterson"}}
