<p>A lot of people seem to think tools like DALL-E and <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3683209/gpt-high-tech-parlor-trick-or-first-real-ai-for-everyday-use.html">ChatGPT</a> are all about replacing workers. In fact, they’re more like useful assistants.</p><p>ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) programs like DALL-E are often thought of as a way to get rid of workers, but that isn’t their real strength. What they really do well is improve on the work people turn out.

<p>For a little more than a year, I’ve been working with <em>winget</em> daily to monitor and maintain my Windows 10 and 11 PCs. For those not already in the know, winget is the built-in, PowerShell-based interface to Microsoft’s Windows Package Manager service.</p><p>Winget is designed to enable “users to discover, install, upgrade, remove and configure applications on Windows 10 and 11 computers,” <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">according to Microsoft Learn</a>. In my experience, winget is helpful for checking and updating most applications that run on Windows.</p><p>Please note: winget is included with Windows 10 version 1709 and later and all versions of Windows 11 as the App Installer. If you’re running an earlier version of Windows 10, visit the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">winget home page</a> at GitHub. There, click the <em>Latest</em> link under “Releases” at right, and download an item named “Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller...msixbundle” (the missing characters identify Microsoft Store apps). Double-click on this item to install it. (Don’t worry: if you do this on a newer Windows version it will inform you, “The App Installer is already installed.”)</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3684171/winget-the-best-way-to-keep-windows-apps-updated.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>How can you have a data fabric strategy without the most valuable data in the enterprise: Mainframe data? That’s like having a dinner party without the main course.</p><p>Data management consistently ranks at the top as a key challenge faced by enterprise organizations. This reality is not surprising as data volume is growing exponentially at a compound annual rate of 23% per year through 2025, according to IDC estimates.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The surge of data, coupled with an increasing need to generate insights for a competitive edge, opens significant opportunities for organizations with the right technology stack and architecture.
