<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest: it&rsquo;s not a great time to build a new desktop. Prices are high on everything, especially the latest and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">(only sometimes) greatest</a> CPUs and GPUs. If you&rsquo;re looking for some practical advice on how to find the best hardware at the best prices, we&rsquo;ve got a special guest over on the PCWorld YouTube channel. Ozi, of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Jxh95N32m1JvKG_-fQ6QQ&amp;xcust=2-1-1477075-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Oz Talks Hardware show</a>, joins Gordon at CES 2023 for some great insights on how to save money on your next build. </p>

<p>Oz knows how to squeeze both PC hardware and the money it costs for everything they&rsquo;re worth. He recommends that builders wait pretty much whenever they can, especially if you&rsquo;re trying to build a sub-$1000 PC. If you can hang on until the second half of the year for a graphics card in particular, you&rsquo;ll be well-positioned to get the best bang for your buck. </p>

## 35,000 PayPal accounts hacked, and users couldâ€™ve prevented it

<p>Another day, another major security breach. Following in the footstep of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448100/twitter-leaked-data-on-over-200-million-users-heres-how-to-check-if-youre-affected.html">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1469048/watch-out-for-phishing-attacks-after-the-latest-credit-breach.html">Experian</a>, on Thursday PayPal began notifying nearly 35,000 users that their accounts were breached between December 6 and 8. What&rsquo;s different here is the method attackers used to crack the accounts. PayPal itself wasn&rsquo;t hacked. Instead, the baddies used an attack known as credential stuffing&mdash;leveraging previously leaked login information that people reused for their PayPal accounts.</p>



<p>&ldquo;During the two days, hackers had access to account holders&rsquo; full names, dates of birth, postal addresses, social security numbers, and individual tax identification numbers,&rdquo; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/paypal-accounts-breached-in-large-scale-credential-stuffing-attack/&amp;xcust=2-1-1478487-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bleeping Computer</a> reports. &ldquo;Transaction histories, connected credit or debit card details, and PayPal invoicing data are also accessible on PayPal accounts.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Oof</strong>.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s some seriously personal information to leak. PayPal halted the intrusion within two days, reset the passwords for affected users, and says no unauthorized transactions were attempted. It&rsquo;s also giving affected users two free years of credit monitoring from Equifax, per Bleeping Computer.</p>



<p>But this attack didn&rsquo;t need to happen. Again: PayPal wasn&rsquo;t hacked, and none of these accounts would have been compromised if their owners followed some fundamental online security practices.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t reuse passwords across accounts, especially ones that hold ultra-sensitive private or banking information (like PayPal). <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">A good password manager</a> makes that easy, and free options are available. Having two-factor authentication enabled also would stymie these credential-stuffing attacks. PayPal offers the security option under its Account Settings menu. Our guide to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1376010/how-to-use-two-factor-authentication-to-lock-down-your-accounts-the-right-way.html">setting up two-factor authentication the right way</a> can help if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the term.</p>



<p>Please do both now if you aren&rsquo;t already. They&rsquo;re the first two pieces of advice in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394001/5-easy-tasks-supercharge-your-security.html">5 easy tasks to supercharge your security</a> for a reason.</p>



<p>PayPal might not have been hacked, but it isn&rsquo;t completely without blame here either. Baber Amin, the COO of Veridium, sent the following thoughts over email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&ldquo;As trusted vendors, PayPal and others need to set a higher bar here.&nbsp; Vendors should implement:</p><p>Processes to monitor and identify anomalous behavior, like the vast number of login failures from a credential stuffing attack.&nbsp; There are multiple tools and services that can do this now. For PayPal to take multiple days to catch this should not be acceptable.</p><p>Actively encourage customers to use two-factor authentication, and not just provide it as an option.</p><p>Actively eliminate passwords from their user-facing systems by fast tracking Fido Passkey adoption.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>



<p>The last part is a bit self-serving, as Veridium is a cybersecurity firm focused on passwordless authentication, but it&rsquo;s still good advice for PayPal. We&rsquo;ve seen major tech companies like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/698137/apple-google-microsoft-commit-to-killing-passwords-entirely.html">Apple, Google, and Microsoft recently commit to passwordless futures</a>.</p>



<p>Until we reach that point, however, protecting your passwords and accounts remains critical, as this PayPal breach drives home. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394001/5-easy-tasks-supercharge-your-security.html">Get your security ducks in a row</a> and stay safe out there, folks.</p>

## Microsoft Office may not open when you restore Windows 11

<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to roll back Windows 11&rsquo;s 2022 Update to an earlier point in time, be careful: several applications within Windows may not open as a result.</p>



<p>Microsoft has published <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5023152-this-app-can-t-open-error-message-when-starting-a-windows-app-in-windows-11-version-22h2-52d63063-a912-4b2b-b0b8-a934d18625bf?ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;ranSiteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-ZOM60oPayWYbzhY1P2PbzA&amp;epi=kXQk6.ivFEQ-ZOM60oPayWYbzhY1P2PbzA&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID2200057_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=%28ir__quu2hwvqqskf6zh3aw2isckjem2xcr9zv1wsavgs00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28kXQk6.ivFEQ-ZOM60oPayWYbzhY1P2PbzA%29%28%29&amp;irclickid=_quu2hwvqqskf6zh3aw2isckjem2xcr9zv1wsavgs00&amp;xcust=2-1-1478434-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">KB5023152</a>, an error message that warns that apps that use the MSIX Windows app format may suffer glitches or simply refuse to open. In plainer English, that means that apps like Office, Cortana, Notepad, Paint, and Terminal may return error messages or simply refuse to launch. But other apps may be affected, too.</p>



<p>The glitches aren&rsquo;t consistent, either. Microsoft lists the following as possible app behaviors: </p>



<ul><li>An error message &ldquo;This app can&rsquo;t open&rdquo; is displayed instead of the app starting.</li><li>The app might have multiple entries on the Start menu.</li><li>An app may not respond when you try to start the app.</li><li>An I/O error may occur, followed by the app not responding, and then the app crashes.</li><li>If you try to start the app again, the app now runs.</li></ul>



<p>Right now, the errors only plague Windows 11 22H2, formally known as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/827065/windows-11-22h2-review-subtle-improvements-but-not-where-it-should.html">Windows 11 2022 Update</a>.  Microsoft does not say that the company is working on a fix, however. For the moment, the company&rsquo;s developers are stymied by the issue. Workarounds include trying to launch the app again, trying to reinstall the app from the Microsoft Store, and running Windows Update&mdash;all of which would be part of any basic troubleshooting.</p>



<p>Ironically, returning to an earlier system restore point is another typical solution to a problem with an application install, as Tom&rsquo;s Hardware, which filed an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-11-22h2-msix-app-failure-system-restore&amp;xcust=2-1-1478434-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">earlier report</a> on the glitch, notes. Hopefully, Microsoft figures all this out soon.</p>

## Are prebuilt PCs really that bad? (feat. Braethorn)

<p>Ask any TRUE PC enthusiast (or any true Scotsman, for that matter), and they&rsquo;ll tell you: the best computer is the one you build yourself. But is that always the case? Gordon grabbed YouTube hardware specialist <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4HRgGa0jwcyAmW0bEwd1_g&amp;xcust=2-1-1477104-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Braethorn</a> at CES 2023 to break it down. You might be surprised at some of the conclusions these two reach! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>To put it bluntly, there are good pre-builts and bad pre-builts, and the good ones are a solid solution for beginners or those without the time to research and build their own machine. And the numbers don&rsquo;t lie: Braethorn notes that about 90 percent of people are building their desktops pre-built, whether or not they take the next step and upgrade or replace some of their parts. </p>



<p>What about things you should look out for? According to Braethorn, little details can ruin a pre-built, and you should take a look under the hood when you get it. Things like packaging crammed into RAM slots and motherboards with failing XMP show that you want to give that new computer a thorough shake-down before the warranty expires. </p>

## The old Windows Photos app is better than the new one, and you can still use it
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477261/windows-11s-old-photos-app-is-still-better.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477261/windows-11s-old-photos-app-is-still-better.html)

<p>Many of us are simply accustomed to using the Photos app within Windows 10 and 11 to review images captured by our phones. But the Photos app is actually the <em>new</em> Photos app &mdash; and, arguably, the old version is still better.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Microsoft seems to have recognized this. What&rsquo;s known as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-photos-legacy/9NV2L4XVMCXM&amp;xcust=2-3-1477261-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Photos Legacy</a> still resides within the Windows Store, and there&rsquo;s one good reason that you might still prefer it over the latest version: its superior content search capabilities.</p>



<p>One of the problems with snapping photos we take is that we tend to take the photo, save it or post it on social media, and then forget about it. But not always. Sometimes you want to pore through old photos &mdash; either to see how your kids have grown up, reminisce about a favorite vacation or event, or simply search for photos that you&rsquo;ve taken of a particular scene. This is where Photos Legacy&hellip; well, not <em>excels</em>, but is far better than the modern Photos app.</p>



<p>The tipoff is in the search box. In the Legacy Photos app, you can search &ldquo;people, places, or things.&rdquo; In the modern Photos app, you can search &ldquo;file names, types, and dates.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s just dumb. Who actually knows the filename of the photo you just took, let alone remember it? And unless it&rsquo;s a holiday or an anniversary, it&rsquo;s completely unlikely that you&rsquo;ll remember when you took the photo, either.</p>



<p>Photos Legacy applies some amount of AI to actually recognize and catalog photos that you&rsquo;ve taken. In Photos Legacy, I can type &ldquo;beach&rdquo; in the search box, and unearth photos of the nearby California coastline. I can search for mountains, and Photos will return photos I&rsquo;ve taken of hills and mountains. It&rsquo;s not perfect; I took a photo of Lake Tahoe (which is surrounded by mountains) which it couldn&rsquo;t find, but it did recognize that the place existed in its archive. Both Photos apps will create &ldquo;Memories&rdquo; of a given day, but only the Legacy app suggests its own categories, such as &ldquo;Sport&rdquo; to organize shots of my son&rsquo;s high-school athletics. I can&rsquo;t do any of this in what is now the default Photos app.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Microsoft Photos Legacy 1" class="image-compare__image-before" height="947" id="1477301" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Photos-Legacy-1.png" width="1485" /><img alt="Microsoft Photos Legacy coral reef" class="image-compare__image-after" height="952" id="1477303" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Photos-legacy-coral-reef.png" width="1493" /></div><figcaption>I searched for &ldquo;beach&rdquo; in the first image, but Photos Legacy suggested &ldquo;coral reef&rdquo; for these photos shot at the Monterey Bay Aquarium a few years back.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Furthermore, Photos Legacy allows you to turn on and search by face &mdash; including your own, and others. It&rsquo;s possible that Microsoft leans much more heavily towards privacy than the competition, since this feature is minimal at best. Of all the photos I&rsquo;ve shot of family and friends, it recognized just two: my own, and the face of a statue downtown that I had used to test some outdoor camera shots. </p>



<p>Both Photos apps are otherwise almost identical, though the newer app feels somewhat more organized and now can access Apple&rsquo;s iCloud too. Both Photos apps now include the thumbnails capability <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/558927/photos-is-the-most-frustrating-app-within-windows.html">that once stunk</a> and then <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563592/microsoft-photos-editing-changes-for-the-better-and-worse.html">has since improved</a>, with speed which has now improved dramatically. Both apps allow you to crop, adjust, and even auto-adjust an image based upon the Auto Enhance capability found under the &ldquo;Filter&rdquo; tab. Auto Enhance isn&rsquo;t as necessary as it once was, as cameras now shoot with nearly perfect lighting and exposure under most conditions. It&rsquo;s still a handy feature to have, nevertheless.</p>



<p>About the only thing that I don&rsquo;t like about Photos Legacy is that indexing (not searching) photos you&rsquo;ve saved to the cloud can take a while, and uses a bit of network bandwidth and data. If you want to use Photos Legacy to index photos, leave it running in the background for a while. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Photos Legacy 2" class="wp-image-1477300" height="762" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Photos-Legacy-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Photos Legacy pales in comparison to Google in terms of facial recognition, but at least it works.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Photo recognition and search, then, is what justifies downloading the Photos Legacy app. To be fair, Microsoft still pales in comparison to Google Photos here. Allowing Google Photos to recognize and separate photos by who&rsquo;s in them creates numerous categories &mdash; even multiple categories for my kids, as they&rsquo;ve aged and become teenagers. Since my wife pays Google for an account for her small business, I can upload my photos to both the Google and Microsoft clouds to compare. Google wins, every time.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Microsoft&rsquo;s Photos app does offer some of these automated recognition features &mdash; but it&rsquo;s not the current Photos app you should be using. Download and launch the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-photos-legacy/9NV2L4XVMCXM&amp;xcust=2-3-1477261-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Photos Legacy app</a> instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630335/geforce-now-review.html">Nvidia GeForce Now</a>, the company&rsquo;s cloud gaming service, has released a GeForce Now Ultimate subscription tier that provides RTX 4080-equivilent hardware, complete with ray tracing and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-5">DLSS 3 support</a>&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve spent several days testing it.</p>



<p>The RTX 4080&rsquo;s might comes flanked by several other GeForce Now enhancements, including support for ultrawide resolutions up to 3,840 x 1,600. Refresh rates get a boost, too, with support for 240Hz at 1080p and 120Hz at up to 4K. The higher refresh rates can also lead to lower total latency, allowing Nvidia to double dip on its marketing claims.</p>



<p>GeForce Now Ultimate launches today for subscribers &ldquo;in and around San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas and Frankfurt, Germany,&rdquo; with a wider rollout coming soon. It&rsquo;s priced at $19.99 per month, or $99.99 every six months (reducing the monthly cost to about $16.66). That&rsquo;s a lot less than buying an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 upfront, but its value depends on how you <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">use a graphics card</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <em><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823826/best-cloud-gaming-services.html">The best cloud gaming services: GeForce Now vs. Xbox Cloud Gaming, and more</a></em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="geforce-now-ultimate-handles-ray-tracing-without-issue">GeForce Now Ultimate handles ray tracing without issue</h2>



<p>GeForce Now Ultimate doesn&rsquo;t promise access to the GeForce RTX 4080 but, rather, access to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html">RTX 4080 SuperPODs</a>. Nvidia says they contain hardware with over 64 TFLOPs of performance. That&rsquo;s more than a retail RTX 4080, which is quoted at 48.75 TFLOPs. The Ultimate service also provides 24 gigabytes of video memory, another improvement from the RTX 4080&rsquo;s 16GB of memory.</p>



<p>What does that mean in reality? To find out, I ran the GeForce Now Ultimate subscription through a few commonly benchmarked games that are available on the service: <em>Far Cry 6</em>, <em>Hitman 3</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. I tried the titles with ray tracing on, but DLSS off, at 1080p and 3,440 x 1,440 ultrawide resolution.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce Now Ultimate benchmarks" class="wp-image-1477081" height="771" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/geforcenowultimategraph.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The results are in line with what I expected. I don&rsquo;t have an RTX 4080 on-hand for a direct comparison, but a broad survey of benchmark results posted by reviewers indicates GeForce Now Ultimate is close to a RTX 4080 desktop graphics card though, perhaps, a bit less performant overall.</p>



<p>The 1080p results are most underwhelming in <em>Far Cry 6</em> and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, where there&rsquo;s little or no difference between 1080p and 3,440 x 1,440 widescreen resolution. That indicates those games are hitting CPU bottlenecks and can&rsquo;t take advantage of the RTX 4080&rsquo;s true power.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>GeForce Now is a great way to play games at ultimate detail settings for a low price.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Performance at 3,440 x 1,440 is more alluring. Even the notoriously demanding <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> averaged 50 frames per second at Ultra settings with all the ray-tracing bells and whistles turned on. <em>Far Cry 6</em> and <em>Hitman 3</em> both averaged above 60fps with the detail dial turned up to eleven.</p>



<p>I benchmarked with DLSS turned off, as each game implements DLSS differently, but it provides big gains when it&rsquo;s turned on. The &ldquo;next-gen&rdquo; update for <em>The Witcher III: The Wild Hunt</em> is an excellent example. The game&rsquo;s performance sat between 45 and 55 FPS at 3,440 x 1,440 resolution, with Ultra settings, all ray traced features on, and DLSS 3 off. Flipping DLSS 3 on roughly doubled that, with performance between 85 and 95 FPS. It&rsquo;s noticeably more fluid.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce Now pricing" class="wp-image-1477082" height="727" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/geforcenowultimatepricing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Nvidia&rsquo;s new GeForce Now pricing structure.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>While framerate is important, there are other aspects of performance such as loading times and stability. GeForce Now Ultimate did well in these areas. Games launch almost as quickly as on my desktop and level load times are comparable. I didn&rsquo;t experience any crashes or performance interruptions. GeForce Now also slashes local power consumption, creating less noise and heat.</p>



<p>In summary: GeForce Now Ultimate mostly accomplishes its goal of delivering RTX 4080 performance. It won&rsquo;t always perform as well as an RTX 4080 installed in a desktop, but it&rsquo;s close. More importantly, GeForce Now Ultimate can deliver 60fps+ in the most demanding modern games with all the settings at maximum. That&rsquo;s what gamers interested in the service will expect of it, and it delivers.</p>



<h2 id="youre-gonna-need-a-good-router-and-internet-connection">You&rsquo;re gonna need a good router (and Internet connection)</h2>



<p>My home is close to ideal for cloud gaming. I have Gigabit Internet service that delivers precisely what it advertises, and Oregon is not too far from Nvidia&rsquo;s data centers in California, which I used for my testing. That&rsquo;s important, as the new RTX 4080 SuperPODs won&rsquo;t be available immediately in most regions.</p>



<p>So, how much bandwidth do you need? A lot less than Gigabit Internet, actually. Playing at 3,440 x 1,440 resolution at up to 120 FPS required no more than 50Mbps and in most cases landed between 30 and 40 Mbps. That&rsquo;s a lot of data but, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/measuring-broadband-america/measuring-fixed-broadband-eleventh-report&amp;xcust=2-1-1477077-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">according to a recent FCC report</a>, the average Internet speed in the U.S. is 193 Mbps.</p>

<p>Packet loss and latency are another concern. Nvidia&rsquo;s built-in connection benchmark asks for a packet loss of less than one percent and latency below 40 milliseconds. These figures are not too hard to achieve over Ethernet or a modern Wi-Fi 5 or Wi-Fi 6 connection, but need to be rock-solid, as any minor hiccup will cause a hitch in the video stream. I experienced a small handful of hiccups in my testing, though none lasted more than the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>The overall latency and reliability of the service left me impressed. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nvidia-geforce-now-review/#dt-heading-latency-and-responsiveness-cloud-gaming-at-lightning-speed&amp;xcust=2-1-1477077-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">I&rsquo;ve used GeForce Now since launch</a> and remember what it was like then: only 1080p resolution up to 60fps, with sometimes noticeable video artifacts due to compression, and network latency of 25 to 35 milliseconds. Today, GeForce Now Ultimate can handle up to 4K at 120fps with typical network latency between 18 and 25 milliseconds, and without noticeable video artifacts. It&rsquo;s usually indistinguishable from playing the game locally.</p>



<h2 id="game-selection-remains-limited">Game selection remains limited</h2>



<p>The performance of GeForce Now Ultimate has its nuances, but I think it lives up to what it promises. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a great experience&mdash;if you own the games that it supports.</p>



<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s boast of support for over 1,500 games seems impressive. That&rsquo;s a lot of games! But gamers are lucky to live in a world where <em>thousands</em> of new titles are released each year.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce Now homescreen" class="wp-image-1477083" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/geforcenowultimateinterface.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith / Foundry</p></div>



<p>As of this article&rsquo;s publication in late January 2023, GeForce Now supports roughly 18 of the 30 most frequently played games on Steam. That&rsquo;s not bad, but a long way from perfect, and some notable titles are missing. <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> are among the no-shows.</p>



<p>I doubt Nvidia can do much to change this situation. This is a legal and business problem more than it is a technical one: the company presumably pays publishers <em>something</em> for rights to these titles, and some publishers are likely unwilling to offer access at any price. Rockstar&rsquo;s games, for example, are not playable on any cloud gaming service.</p>



<h2 id="geforce-now-ultimate-best-in-small-doses-and-thats-ok">GeForce Now Ultimate: Best in small doses, and that&rsquo;s ok</h2>



<p>GeForce Now Ultimate costs $19.99 per month or $99.99 semi-annually. That&rsquo;s $239.88 or $199.98 per year, depending on which of the two options you choose.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GeForce Now Ultimate playing Witcher 3 on an ultrawide monitor" class="wp-image-1477084" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/geforcenowultimate.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>binary comment</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith / Foundry</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s significantly less expensive than buying your own GeForce RTX 4080, but GeForce Now Ultimate is more limited in what it can do. It has access to a slim library of about 1,500 compatible games, can&rsquo;t stream above 240fps, and can&rsquo;t be used to accelerate professional applications. It&rsquo;s not a true alternative to a graphics card in your desktop.</p>



<p>However, while GeForce Now Ultimate doesn&rsquo;t replace local hardware, I&rsquo;d argue the service delivers more frames per dollar than any alternative. This is good news for gamers who are unwilling or unable to pay more than a few hundred dollars for hardware in an era of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html">exorbitant graphics card prices</a>. GeForce Now is a great way to play games at ultimate detail settings for a low price&mdash;if the game you want to play is supported, of course.</p>

</div>


<p>Want a fast Chromebook? The Acer Chromebook Spin 514 is likely to land near the top of your search. Powered by AMD&rsquo;s six-core Ryzen 5 5625C processor, the Spin 514 offers an alternative to competitors with the Intel Core i5-1240P and delivers big gains over Chromebooks with Qualcomm or MediaTek hardware. However, those seeking budget laptop thrills may find the Windows alternatives more appealing.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Looking for more options? Check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html">best Chromebooks</a>.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="acer-chromebook-spin-514-specs-and-features">Acer Chromebook Spin 514: Specs and features</h2>



<p>The Acer Chromebook Spin 514 is powered by AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 5 5625C, a six-core, 12-thread processor that includes AMD Radeon Graphics with seven graphics cores. It&rsquo;s beefy hardware for a Chromebook, and the configuration tested represents a premium model. Acer sells several less powerful versions of the Spin 514 with Ryzen 3 processors.</p>



<ul><li><strong>CPU</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 5625C&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8GB LPDDR4X</li><li><strong>Graphics</strong>/GPU: AMD Radeon Graphics&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Display</strong>: 1920 x 1080 IPS Touchscreen</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: 128GB&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Webcam</strong>: 720p</li><li><strong>Connectivity</strong>: 2x USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 with Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode, 1x USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, HDMI, 3.5mm Audio-out</li><li><strong>Networking</strong>: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2</li><li><strong>Biometrics</strong>: None</li><li><strong>Battery capacity</strong>: 39 watt-hour</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 11.81 x 9.25 x .64 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 3.31 pounds</li><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $699.99</li></ul>



<p>Premium hardware comes at a premium price (for a Chromebook). The Acer Chromebook Spin 514 with AMD Ryzen 5 5625C will set shoppers back almost $700 at MSRP. Less performant models are less expensive, however:<a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Facer-chromebook-spin-514-laptop-convertible-14-full-hd-touch-ryzen-3-3250c-gb-ddr4-memory-64gb-emmc-flash-memory%2F6447818.p%3FskuId%3D6447818&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow"> versions with the AMD Ryzen 3 3250C</a> and half as much RAM and storage are under $400 at some online retailers.</p>



<h2 id="acer-chromebook-spin-514-design-and-build-quality">Acer Chromebook Spin 514: Design and build quality </h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 514 display" class="wp-image-1475675" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-chromebook-spin-514-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Acer Chromebook Spin 514 isn&rsquo;t a lavish laptop, and doesn&rsquo;t look unique: if not for a chrome Acer logo on the lid, most people would never know who made it. Yet it&rsquo;s functional, sturdy, and modestly luxurious. Much of the chassis is built from metal, the display bezels are thin, and the interior presents an elegant contrast of silver and black surfaces.</p>



<p>As its name implies, the Chromebook Spin 514 includes a 360-degree hinge and touchscreen. The display folds back for use as a tablet, or to use the keyboard as a kickstand for the display. This versatility is appreciated and genuinely useful. I often use 2-in-1s as a tablet when reclining in a chair and breezing through the day&rsquo;s headlines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the Spin 514 is too large to replace a tablet in many situations. It weighs over three pounds and measures .64 inches thick, making it roughly twice the size and heft of a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and over three times heavier than an iPad Air. It&rsquo;s awkward to hold with one hand and clumsy to use as an e-reader when lying in bed.</p>



<h2 id="acer-chromebook-spin-514-keyboard-and-trackpad">Acer Chromebook Spin 514: Keyboard and trackpad </h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 514 keyboard" class="wp-image-1475676" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-chromebook-spin-514-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Fortunately, the Chromebook Spin 514 is a much better laptop than it is a tablet. In fact, the Spin 514 is a great laptop for basic, day-to-day use.</p>



<p>Credit the keyboard. The Spin 514&rsquo;s chassis provides ample space for a wide keyboard layout with large, easily located keys. The left-side Shift, Control, and Alt keys are massive, and the function keys (which include support for the usual Chrome OS function row shortcuts) are larger than those found on Windows or Mac alternatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key feel is excellent, too, with deep travel and a firm, tactile bottom action that ends with a light but satisfying click. Touch typists will fly across the keyboard in no-time, while those who take the hunt-and-peck approach will quickly find the correct key. A backlit keyboard is standard, making keys readable in a dark room.</p>



<p>The touchpad is excellent, too. It&rsquo;s spacious, measuring about 4.75 inches wide and 3.25 inches thick, and has a smooth low-friction surface. Multi-touch gestures are easy to use (though Chrome OS supports fewer than Windows or MacOS). And though the touchpad is pleasant, the touchscreen offers an alternative option that can be useful when navigating Android apps or web apps built for mobile devices.</p>



<h2 id="acer-chromebook-spin-514-display-audio">Acer Chromebook Spin 514: Display, audio </h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 514" class="wp-image-1475627" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-chromebook-spin-514-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Acer ships the Chromebook Spin 514 with an IPS touchscreen that boasts 1920&times;1080 resolution. This isn&rsquo;t the best display you can find on a Chromebook from Acer: the Spin 513 has a more pixel-dense 13.5-inch 2256&times;1504 screen, which is as crisp and tasty as a fresh potato chip. Still, the Spin 514&rsquo;s display looks plenty sharp.</p>



<p>Resolution aside, Spin 514&rsquo;s image quality is good but not great. The biggest problem? Brightness. I measured a maximum brightness of only 312 nits, which is plenty for day-to-day use indoors but inadequate when used outdoors or near a sunlit window. The display&rsquo;s glossy coating doesn&rsquo;t help matters and shows clear, bright reflections that distract from what&rsquo;s on-screen. Put simply: the Spin 514 is a laptop best left indoors (and away from windows).</p>



<p>The display&rsquo;s contrast and color performance are adequate for a modern laptop. 1080p video content looks realistic and vivid. However, the IPS display <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1428656/these-new-asus-laptops-may-have-the-best-display-youve-ever-seen.html">is pressured by new laptops with OLED screens</a>, some of which are priced just one to two hundred dollars higher than the Spin 514. OLED laptops offer an improvement in contrast and color performance that most people will easily notice and prefer. The Spin 514&rsquo;s low brightness remains a concern: LCD laptop screens are often brighter than OLED, but that&rsquo;s not true here.</p>



<p>A pair of upward-firing speakers provide the Spin 514&rsquo;s audio. They&rsquo;re not excellent, but loud enough at maximum volume to fill an office with sound. The speakers work best with podcasts and video content, as loud music can cause unpleasant distortion.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="acer-chromebook-spin-514-webcam-microphone-biometrics">Acer Chromebook Spin 514: Webcam, microphone, biometrics </h2>



<p>A 1080p webcam with a physical privacy shutter is squeezed into the laptop&rsquo;s top bezel. It&rsquo;s a nice upgrade over a 720p camera and delivers a clear improvement in sharpness. Color reproduction is also good in a well-lit room. Exposure was often a bit off, though, causing big swings in my skin tone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The built-in is nothing special, but it does the job. Backup noise will often be picked up, but recordings of my voice offered good volume and seemed easy to understand when played back. It&rsquo;s fine for most video calls.</p>



<p>The laptop doesn&rsquo;t offer biometric login.</p>



<h2 id="acer-chromebook-spin-514-connectivity">Acer Chromebook Spin 514: Connectivity </h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 514 connectivity" class="wp-image-1475677" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acer-chromebook-spin-514-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Acer leans into future-proof connectivity with a pair of USB-C ports, one on each side. The laptop ships with a USB-C charger and both ports support USB Power Delivery, so either can be used to power and charge the Chromebook. The ports also have DisplayPort Alternate Mode and can be used as video output to a USB-C monitor (or other monitors, with appropriate adapter).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The USB-C ports are joined by a single USB-A port, HDMI-out, and 3.5mm audio out. I&rsquo;d prefer to see a second USB-A port and a MicroSD card reader. Still, the Spin 514&rsquo;s connectivity should be enough for most people.</p>



<p>Wireless options include Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. Wi-Fi performance was speedy and reliable in my testing, achieving about 250 Mbps two rooms away from my router and up to 80 Mbps in an exterior office 60 feet away from the router.</p>



<h2 id="acer-chromebook-spin-514-performance">Acer Chromebook Spin 514: Performance </h2>



<p>The Acer Chromebook Spin 514 is available with several AMD Ryzen processors including the six-core, 12-thread AMD Ryzen 5 5625C. It comes paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of solid state storage which, again, is top-notch for a Chromebook.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the powerful processor delivered excellent results in benchmarks.</p>



<ul><li>CrXPRT 2 performance score: 199</li><li>Speedometer 2.0: 210</li><li>Basemark Web 3.0: 1024.38</li><li>Kraken Javascript 1.1: 522.6</li><li>Jetstream: 222.991</li></ul>



<p>These scores defeat <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/626194/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-an-inexpensive-workhorse-for-the-everyday-person.html">the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 with Intel Core i5-1135G7</a>. In CrXPT 2, the Spin 514&rsquo;s score of 199 easily exceeds the Spin 713, which hit 164, and demolishes the Snapdragon-powered <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/609500/hp-chromebook-x2-11-da0023dx-review.html">HP Chromebook x2 11</a>&rsquo;s score of just 52. The Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 with Intel Pentium Gold 7505 also falls behind with a score of 124.</p>



<p>The Spin 514 loses against the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431799/framework-laptop-chromebook-review.html">Framework Laptop Chromebook</a> with an Intel Core i5-1240P processor, but it&rsquo;s a close contest. The Intel Core i5-1240P in the Framework is about five percent quicker than the Spin 514 overall. That&rsquo;s not a noticeable difference and the two will seem identical in typical use.</p>



<p>Real-world performance feels as snappy as the Spin 514&rsquo;s benchmark scores suggest. Juggling many browser tabs is not a problem. New apps open in a blink. Files transfer quickly. To be honest, the Spin 514&rsquo;s is overkill for the tasks most Chrome OS users are likely to ask of it, but the extra performance headroom will help future-proof the laptop.</p>



<p>While the Spin 514 performs well, the Windows competition must be mentioned. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Aspire-i7-1160G7-Backlit-Accessories/dp/B0B6VTSBWF/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2444FTKH2S368&amp;keywords=acer+aspire+5+ryzen+5825u&amp;qid=1673897413&amp;sprefix=acer+aspire+5+ryzen+5825u%2Caps%2C141&amp;sr=8-4&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.2b70bf2b-6730-4ccf-ab97-eb60747b8daf&amp;xcust=2-1-1475407-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Acer&rsquo;s Aspire 5 with Ryzen 5 5500U, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage</a> can be found for under $700. The same is true of Lenovo IdeaPad and Flex models, HP&rsquo;s entry-level 14-inch and 15-inch laptops, and Dell&rsquo;s Inspiron line. The increased RAM and storage in Windows alternatives will allow them to accomplish tasks the Spin 514 can&rsquo;t handle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What about games? It&rsquo;s a mix bag. Android games are not reliable, likely due to the Spin 514&rsquo;s x86-based hardware, which differs significantly from that found in most Android devices. <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em> crashed to the desktop after the launch screen. <em>Pokemon Unite</em> launched, but I couldn&rsquo;t get the game past the login screen. <em>Asphalt 8</em> was playable, at least, and appeared to run at an acceptable frame rate.</p>



<p>Cloud gaming is a better option and works well over Wi-Fi 6. I launched Nvidia GeForce Now to enjoy an hour of <em>Marvels&rsquo; Guardians of the Galaxy</em> at 1080p resolution with Ultra settings and ray tracing enabled. It looked as gorgeous as it does locally on a high-end video card. However, GeForce Now works equally well on less capable hardware, so the Spin 514 can&rsquo;t take credit for this result.</p>



<h2 id="acer-chromebook-spin-514-battery-life">Acer Chromebook Spin 514: Battery life </h2>



<p>The AMD Ryzen 5625C is mighty, but it has a default thermal design power of just 15 watts and is capable of sipping power when needed. The laptop lasted 13 hours and 13 minutes in the CrXPRT 2 battery life test. That&rsquo;s right on par with the Framework Laptop Chromebook and just slightly short of the older Acer Spin 713.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In real-world use, the laptop can last even longer in light use such as streaming video or working in Google Docs with the display set at a low level of brightness. The laptop can handle an eight-hour workday with at least a couple hours of battery left in the tank.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="acer-chromebook-spin-514-conclusion">Acer Chromebook Spin 514: Conclusion</h2>



<p>The Acer Chromebook Spin 514 is among the quickest Chromebooks currently available, defeated only by alternatives with Intel&rsquo;s Core i5-1240P processor (and it&rsquo;s a close call). The Spin 514 also benefits from a great keyboard, nice touchpad, attractive display, long battery life, and useful USB-C ports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pricing is the obstacle. The Spin 514&rsquo;s price tag of almost $700 feels expensive when compared to Windows laptops. The Acer Aspire 5, Lenovo IdeaPad 5, and HP 14 offer similar processors at similar prices but have more RAM and solid state storage. The Spin 514 is available in less expensive configurations, however. They&rsquo;re a better choice for most people, delivering most of the Spin 514&rsquo;s perks with a modest (and acceptable) reduction in performance.</p>

## The one password manager setting you should always change

<p>As helpful as password managers are, many have a surprisingly lax attitude toward the information you copy from them. Load up the password for your most sensitive account and that info will just sit on your clipboard indefinitely, accessible to all other apps on your phone or PC&mdash;or even remote devices, if you have cloud clipboard features enabled. You don&rsquo;t need to paste the text into those apps for them to see it, either.</p>



<p>Fortunately, a ten-second tweak of your settings nips this security risk in the bud. It&rsquo;s truly simple:</p>



<ul><li>Open your password manager&rsquo;s browser extension, mobile app, or desktop program.&nbsp;</li><li>In its settings, find the option for clipboard clearing or clipboard expiration.</li><li>Change the default of &ldquo;Never&rdquo; or &ldquo;Off&rdquo; to a time span that you can work with. If your password manager already has this covered, you can instead adjust duration to better suit your needs.</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bitwarden, Keeper, and NordPass's default clipboard settings" class="wp-image-1471892" height="863" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pwdmanagerapp_composite-mrk.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Examples of the settings from the mobile apps for Bitwarden (left), Keeper (center), and NordPass (right)&mdash;the settings for the browser extensions look similar. You can see how two of the three default to never clearing the clipboard.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Ideally, you should do this right after installing the password manager. If 2023 has proven anything so far, it&rsquo;s the need for tighter security. A <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">trustworthy password manager</a> plays a major role in maintaining your privacy and how you configure and use it influences how effective it is. You can&rsquo;t avoid data breaches (especially the big kinds we&rsquo;ve recently heard about at <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448100/twitter-leaked-data-on-over-200-million-users-heres-how-to-check-if-youre-affected.html">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1469048/watch-out-for-phishing-attacks-after-the-latest-credit-breach.html">Experian</a>), but you can minimize the resulting splash damage.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to make the most of your password manager once you&rsquo;ve settled in, too.
