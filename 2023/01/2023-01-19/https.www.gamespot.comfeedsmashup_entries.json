Based on early gameplay footage and the wealth of announced content, golfers have a lot to be excited for.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">EA Sports is really emphasizing Major championships with this new release. Unlike the game's main competitor (PGA Tour 2K23), all four of golf's most prestigious tournaments will be included. That means you'll get to tee it up at the famous August National, home of the Masters Tournament, as well as the US Open, PGA Championship, and The Open.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">At launch, EA Sports PGA Tour will have an expansive lineup of 30 real courses, including all of the Major championship tracks from 2021 through 2023. To promote accuracy, EA Sports used drones and LiDAR helicopters--which are specifically designed for mapping--to create realistic terrain. Though the average golf fan most likely wouldn't be able to spot inconsistencies in green contours or fairway undulations, EA said that even Augusta National's expert caddies noticed the realism. The caddies putted on the greens without in-game assist measures and found that their local knowledge was enough to drain putts.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-pga-tour-releases-march-24-course-list-revealed/1100-6510683/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-stampede-how-to-watch-what-streaming-service-is-it-on-dubbed-version-debut-and-when-does-it-air/1100-6510682/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Trigun Stampede: How To Watch, What Streaming Service Is It On, Dubbed Version Debut, And When Does It Air?", "date_published": "2023-01-19 15:36:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">A staple of '90s anime, Trigun was one of the handful of series during that time that broke into the American mainstream.
