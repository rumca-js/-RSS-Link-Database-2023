  <p id="dlTpO3">The era of Netflix password sharing will soon come to a close. Netflix has plans to enforce password-sharing rules “more broadly” toward the end of the first quarter of 2023, the company announced in its <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/FINAL-Q4-22-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">earnings report today</a>.</p>
<p id="9dwS2k">“While our terms of use limit use of Netflix to a household, we recognize this is a change for members who share their account more broadly,” Netflix writes. “As we roll out paid sharing, members in many countries will also have the option to pay extra if they want to share Netflix with people they don’t live with.”</p>
<p id="9rvatO">The company also announced that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/23324634">CEO Reed Hastings is stepping down</a> after 25 years of running the company and will pass the baton to Ted Sarandos, who had already been serving as co-CEO, and Greg Peters,...</p>

<p id="FimiNU">Now a bunch of Republicans are taking the concept of “getting ICE’d” to the next logical conclusion. Not content to simply obstruct a parking spot, they are instead looking to stymie the growth of EVs through ill-considered policy decisions.

  <p id="G7oofA">WhatsApp will now let you freely message yourself. The new Message Yourself feature has been gradually rolling out to WhatsApp users over the past couple of months and has appeared in the release notes for the latest app update this week. It’s not Meta’s latest AI invention but more of a digital notepad to let you send quick notes, reminders, links, and photos to yourself across multiple devices.</p>
<p id="GMHlMO">You could also use this feature to have a full-blown conversation with yourself, but I wouldn’t recommend it. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/28/23481881/message-self-whatsapp-messages-slack-signal">My colleague David Pierce texts himself every day</a> to share links, notes, and reminders that are all searchable across devices.</p>

  <p id="tpAvKT">Ahead of the Game Developers Conference in March, the organizers of the event have released its annual State of the Industry survey results. Surveying 2,300 respondents, the questionnaire covered developer sentiment on a wide range of topics, including NFTs, unionization, the metaverse, and more.</p>
<p id="kU7CP8">As overall sentiment on NFTs cools amid continuous stories of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23507361/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-alameda-cftc-complaint-lies">fraud</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22995107/us-arrest-charges-crypto-nft-rug-pull-frosties-ethan-nguyen-andre-llacuna">scandal</a>, the GDC survey reports only 23 percent of developers say that their studios are interested in Web3 technology — a slight decline from 27 percent last year.

<p id="68x8QY">Instagram will specifically prompt teen users to toggle on Quiet Mode “when they spend a specific amount of time on Instagram late at night.” However, the platform doesn’t specify how much time teens have to spend on the app to see the prompt and also doesn’t say what timeframe it considers “late at night.” Meta spokesperson Liza Crenshaw tells <em>The Verge</em> the notification will appear after “several minutes.”</p>

<p id="gkykTq">Along with providing users with a blue “verified” checkmark, a subscription to Twitter Blue currently grants users access to the ability to edit tweets, upload longer 1080p videos, and access reader mode.

  <p id="VNY5Fn">With 2016’s <em>Train to Busan</em>, director Yeon Sang-ho managed to do something surprising: offer a fresh take on a zombie story, one of the most well-trod genres around. Now, he’s tackling yet another oversaturated space with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23520926/jung-e-netflix-teaser-trailer-release-date"><em>Jung_E</em></a>, a sci-fi tale about how humanity will adapt to living alongside AI. The new film introduces some fascinating ideas about class and technology, along with some very fun action sequences. But it manages to stand out mostly thanks to its extremely personal take on our AI future.</p>
<p id="i8IDHZ">The movie is also notable for being the final on-screen performance from Kang Soo-yeon, a Korean star who died suddenly last May. <em>Jung_E</em> represents not only her last role but also a return to the screen after nearly a decade away. </p>

  		 <p>For $20 a month, Nvidia will rent you an RTX 4080 gaming PC in the cloud. It feels phenomenal in some games, but there’s still work to be done. </p>

  <p id="njerGq">A developer has put together a GPT-3 demo that attempts to enhance Apple’s Siri voice assistant and allow far more conversational voice commands. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/10f580i/i_built_the_worlds_smartest_homekit_voice/">video posted to Reddit</a>, developer Mate Marschalko shows the assistant controlling his HomeKit smart home devices and responding to queries in response to relatively vague prompts that today’s voice assistants like Siri would typically struggle to understand.</p>
<p id="UjZmea">For example, the AI is shown turning on Marschalko’s lights in response to the voice prompt “Just noticed that I’m recording this video in the dark in the office, can you do something about that?” Later on in the video Marschalko asks the assistant to set his bedroom to a temperature that would “help me sleep better,” and it responds...</p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZHNevE">Google made a few mistakes with its Stadia cloud gaming service. Maybe <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964386/google-stadia-pre-launch-editorial-cloud-gaming">more than a few</a>. Okay, it made a lot of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel">promises it didn’t keep</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/30/23378757/google-stadia-commitments-shutdown-rumors">said a lot of things</a> that look pretty laughable in hindsight and totally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/30/23381106/google-stadia-shutdown-shocked-developers-too">pulled the rug out from under its indie developers</a>. We did <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964386/google-stadia-pre-launch-editorial-cloud-gaming">our best</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option">warn you</a>! </p>
<p id="pMMTbs">And yet, I <em>don’t</em> think Stadia will be remembered poorly now it’s gone — because in the end, Google did right by its customers. Pay attention, rival companies: this is how you shut down a service right.</p>
<p id="6lcEGl">I can’t remember a company ever trying so hard to erase its mistakes: Stadia users got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23449333/google-stadia-store-software-refunds">full hardware and software refunds</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23543108/google-stadia-shutdown-time-transfer-games-saves">save game transfers</a>, even a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23561263/get-your-stadia-salute-emoji-ready">final celebratory test game</a> they could play on the eve of the shutdown.

  <p id="CPXRvk">Amazon is shutting down its AmazonSmile charity program next month. The closure coincides with a variety of cost-cutting efforts announced by the e-commerce giant that includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560874/amazon-layoffs-18000-january-november">laying off thousands of employees</a>.</p>
<p id="GjOrdm">The <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/charity?orig=%2F">AmazonSmile</a> program functioned like an overlay for the standard Amazon site, allowing users to shop as normal, but select a charity to which the e-retailer donated 0.5 percent of the cost of all eligible products. Amazon claims that <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/impact/community/amazonsmile">over $377 million</a> has been donated through the scheme since it launched in 2013, but in its closure notice suggested this was not sufficient to keep the scheme running.</p>

## Amazon’s OSHA fine for warehouse safety violations could be about $60K

  <p id="q4Ukg1">The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, has issued a citation against Amazon, alleging that the company violated safety laws and failed to keep workers in three warehouses safe. The regulator has also proposed $60,269 in penalties related to the violations — a drop in the bucket for a company that <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2022/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results/">recorded over $127 billion in sales </a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23416918/amazon-q3-2022-earnings-sales-up-holiday-season-andy-jassy">during the third quarter of 2022</a><a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2022/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results/"> alone</a> but a relatively high penalty compared to many of the ones it faced from OSHA before.</p>
<p id="GsQNmk"><a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/01182023">According to a press release</a>, the citation stems from inspections at three warehouses located in Deltona, Florida, Waukegan, Illinois, and New Windsor, New York. OSHA says that Amazon “exposed workers to ergonomic, struck-by hazards” in the location, putting them at...</p>
