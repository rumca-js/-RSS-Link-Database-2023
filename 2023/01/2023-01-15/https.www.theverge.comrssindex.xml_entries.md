  <p id="NCDusV">Tweetbot is mostly up and running after an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/13/23553161/third-party-twitter-clients-apps-outage-twitterific-tweetbot">outage locked users out of major third-party Twitter clients</a>. While users can now sign in to Tweetbot and browse through tweets, <a href="https://twitter.com/stevebrazill/status/1614719858339610624?s=20&amp;t=_0CJP61RpmWFcarfRIS4Cw">some say</a> they still can’t post anything to Twitter through the service without getting an error message stating they’ve reached a “data limit.”</p>
<p id="gkfqsp">The client isn’t back online because of anything that Twitter did, though. Tweetbot co-creator Paul Haddad tells <em>The Verge</em> that they still haven’t heard anything from Twitter, so they’ve “decided to start using new API keys and see if it fixes the problem.” This could allow Tweetbot to temporarily avoid any disruptions to the service, even if it puts it in a semi-working state.</p>

<p id="4QCNZz">Elon Musk has said he will find a new CEO for Twitter after users <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604617643973124097">voted for him to leave</a>. But who would, in <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1605372724800393216?lang=en">his own words</a>, be “foolish enough to take the job”?</p>
<p id="lbjaKv">It’s a question I’ve been posing in conversations over the past week. Based on my checks with people who would know, Musk doesn’t appear to be running a formal search yet. And given his propensity to <s>lie</s> go back on his word, he might not try to find someone. The matter is complicated by his saying that, even after finding a CEO, he will still run the “software &amp; servers teams.” That’s basically the whole company.</p>
<p id="oQldJN">For what it’s worth, I do think...</p>

  <p id="B4U7hy">England’s taking its single-use plastics ban even further by restricting the sale of plastic cutlery, plates, bowls, trays, balloon sticks, as well as certain kinds of polystyrene cups and food containers (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/england-banning-the-sale-of-some-single-use-plastics-222344569.html">via <em>Engadget</em></a>). According to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/far-reaching-ban-on-single-use-plastics-in-england">an announcement</a> on the English government’s website, the new ban will go into effect in October of this year. </p>
<p id="xJvMtZ">Once the ban comes into force, people will no longer be able to buy or obtain these single-use plastics from businesses, including retailers, restaurants, food vendors, and other locations.</p>
<p id="IEqb7L">The ban won’t affect the plastic plates, trays, or bowls that come with pre-packaged food items, though, as they’re already included in the country’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/packaging-waste-prepare-for-extended-producer-responsibility">Extended Producer Responsibility Scheme</a>. This initiative...</p>
