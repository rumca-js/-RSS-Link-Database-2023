<p>Stephen Colbert imitated Biden's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/corvette-biden-doocy" target="_blank">defense</a> over the documents found in his garage, which was basically, "I have a Corvette!" Colbert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q6JVvuqf3g" target="_blank">donned</a> aviators and said, “Come on, it’s in a locked garage. You’d think I’d leave my sweet cherry Vette out on the main drag where some street thugs could scuff it with their switchblades? No sirree. I keep that baby locked up tight in my garage. Sunday afternoons, I go in there and buff it with a handful of missile maps.”</p><p>Colbert also attempted to explain why this is totally, completely, 100% different from Donald Trump having secret documents, even though Biden <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/biden-greater-criminal-risk-trump-documents-scandal-lawyer-1773755" target="_blank">likely</a> did not have the authority to declassify intelligence memos as Vice President. Colbert cited Trump's noncompliance and "nefarious" behavior, and concluded with: "The FBI raids Mar-a-Lago and finds hundreds of documents and he [Trump] goes, ‘Oh I knew I had those, I packed them myself, but don’t worry, I declassified them with my mind.’”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

The piece is called "Embrace" and is modeled after a photo of Martin Luther King and his wife. But for some odd reason, the artist decided to only include their arms and not their heads or other discerning features. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>This statue is pretty special as it seems to have shapeshifting abilities. Many say it represents a large penis. Others, a butt. And still, some say it represents a giant turd. What no one is saying, however, is that it looks anything like Martin Luther King and his wife. </p><p>The artist said of the statue, "not everyone has arms and hands, but all of us have been embraced." Okay...sure. But why does it look like a giant phallus? The design miraculously beat out 125 other design proposals, which I would be very curious to see. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Perhaps we're all just too dim-witted to understand the complexities and interpretations of modern art. Surely, this is better than the cathedrals and paintings of the Middle Ages. It's reinventing the wheel!</p><p>On the bright side, in terms of modern art, it could be much, much worse. Remember when Catholic University of America displayed a painting of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/queen-brit-journalist-mock" target="_blank">George Floyd</a> as Jesus? </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cNEW: Paintings depicting George Floyd as Jesus Christ hang in both The Catholic University of America\u2019s campus ministry office and its law school, students say.\n\n\u201cIt is just another symptom of the liberalization and secularization of our campus." \n\nhttps://t.co/EkJtP229tw\u201d</div> — Mary Margaret Olohan (@Mary Margaret Olohan)

</blockquote>
<p>The painting, called "Mama," was protested by students and stolen twice.  After facing nationwide backlash, the University claimed the painting depicted Jesus and not George Floyd, citing the Greek letters in the halo that signify Jesus's divinity. But the artist previously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/arts/design/george-floyd-painting-catholic-university.html" target="_blank">said</a> it was created to mourn the death of George Floyd.  </p><p>So, while the statue of Martin Luther King is bad, at least it isn't blasphemous! Which I guess is the bar for modern art now. </p><p>But it still looks like a penis. </p><p><p>

## Maren Morris sobs to Ru Paul and apologizes for how not woke the country music industry is

	Maren Morris is a woke hardo. Every time she speaks, she wants everyone to know she "thinks" all the right things and isn't like those other backward rubes who listen to or work in country music. The latest example is the pop star getting emotional on RuPaul's Drag Race. 
	<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-drag-race" target="_blank">It's the Grand Ol' Opry for virtue signaling</a>.
</p><p>
	Morris was a guest and sobbed while telling Ru it was her "decade-long DREAM" to be a judge on the game show.

<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/maren-morris-rupauls-drag-race-addresses-country-music-treatment-lgbtq-community-1235299866/" target="_blank">Then came this</a>:
</p><blockquote>
	Coming from country music and its relationship with LGBTQ+ members, I just want to say I’m sorry. And I love you guys for making me feel like a brave voice in country music. So I just thank you guys so much for inspiring me.

<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="50d93" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32849209&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>
	Unclear is if she had something specific in mind, or if Morris still can't calm down about the Brittany Aldean controversy from last year. To recap, Aldean posted the following video to her Instagram page. It was a humorous commentary on the parents who express their political beliefs by pushing their own gender-based ideology on their children.

</blockquote></div><p>
<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brittany-aldean-tomboy-instagram" target="_self">Morris attacked her for it</a>, claiming "It’s so easy to, like, not be a scumbag human? Sell your clip-ins and zip it, Insurrection Barbie."</p><p>
	Country star Jason Aldean, Brittany's husband, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-brittany-instagram" target="_self">snarked about it as he came to her defense</a>. He was dropped <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jason-aldean-cancelled-pr" target="_self">by his long-time PR firm as a result</a>. Though the Aldeans got the last laugh <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brittany-aldean-jason-anchorman-halloween" target="_blank">on Halloween with a parody of <em>Anchorman</em></a>.</p><p>
	Last we heard, Morris was "uncomfortable" being around her peers and boycotted the CMA awards.

<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="2f0ec" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32849200&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Besides being a country fan, I'm also a conservative punk rock fan. A lot of the artists I listen to there have a way different political opinion than me. It is what it is. Separate the art from the artist and all that. My only issues are when a) the artist is an insufferable douche about it, and b) the artist sounds like they hate the half the country that disagrees with them just to score woke points. </p><p>Morris is on the wrong side of history in both those cases. And while I like the cut Maren did with Thomas Rhett and thought <em>Girl</em> was a good album, it wasn't that good. </p><p>Plus, I seemed to recall her being attacked as an alleged "culture vulture" by the same people whose approval she is desperate for now.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Mel Brooks releases trailer for 'History of the World Part 2' and I want to believe it won't stink on ice

Though thanks to Ye, I don't think we're getting "Jews in Space." I see a few of my colleagues who are all like "ZOMG, this means you can still make comedy in America." I have my doubts about this.</p><p>First, let's hear from Uncle Mel.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The names you know. The history you don’t.

<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="fd3bc" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=32849102&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>I have two big concerns. The first is, when was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-wokeness-comedy-movies" target="_blank">the last time you remember a laugh-out-loud comedy</a>? Studios are more concerned with what bloggers or random idiots on Twitter a joke may offend than to allow a movie to be funny. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="3db03" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32849110&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The only exception is if you are offending people for the "right" political reasons.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="0297f" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32849112&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>There are a number of names attacked to this project that are red flags: <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/actor-josh-gad-has-a-meltdown-on-instagram-over-social-distancing-video" target="_blank">Josh Gad</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wanda-sykes-anti-trump-boos" target="_blank">Wanda Sykes</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/comedy-is-dead-seth-rogen-fawns-over-anti-free-speech-trudeau" target="_blank">Seth Rogen</a>, etc.</p><p>My other concern is 99.86% of all reboots SUCK. There are exceptions. <em>Cobra Kai</em> gets it right, and I loved the new <em>Kids in the Hall</em> series. The rest are horrible. They come across as a parody of the source material people loved. Which in this case would be a parody of a parody. </p><p>Will <em>History of the World Part 2</em> be a Mel Brooks project? Or will it be something that is trying too hard to be a Mel Brooks project?</p><p>Uncle Mel is listed as one of the two writers on IMDB. That's a good sign. And he has yet to let me down. Remember, we all agreed never to speak of <em>Dracula Dead and Loving It</em>.</p><p><em>History of the World Part 2 </em>drops on Hulu on March 6th. I'm hoping for the best.</p><p><p>
