The matter is complicated by his saying that, even after finding a CEO, he will still run the \u201csoftware &amp; servers teams.\u201d That\u2019s basically the whole company.</p>\n<p id=\"oQldJN\">For what it\u2019s worth, I do think...</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/15/23556300/who-should-be-twitter-next-ceo-after-elon-musk\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/15/23556068/england-single-use-plastic-plates-cutlery-ban", "title": "England\u2019s banning plastic plates and cutlery later this year", "date_published": "2023-01-15 16:43:58+00:00", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"An image showing a plastic spoon littered on the beach\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pCIh9k2X4Dfvw9fHhu34FtV5IYE=/0x125:3475x2442/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71868404/1408754732.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption><em>England already has restrictions on plastic straws, drink stirrers, and cotton swabs.</em> | Photo By Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"B4U7hy\">England\u2019s taking its single-use plastics ban even further by restricting the sale of plastic cutlery, plates, bowls, trays, balloon sticks, as well as certain kinds of polystyrene cups and food containers (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/england-banning-the-sale-of-some-single-use-plastics-222344569.html\">via <em>Engadget</em></a>).
