<p>Confidence is high for the injury-free 35-year-old for his opener against Matteo Berrettini after a productive off-season</p><p>At the end of another arduous British grass-court summer last year, Andy Murray departed Wimbledon frustrated. He had been defeated in the second round <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/29/andy-murray-blown-out-of-wimbledon-by-sheer-power-of-john-isner">by the towering American John Isner</a>, yet had not even done much wrong. Isner played a brilliant match, serving 38 aces, and the quality of his performance underlined one clear issue: Murray’s ranking.</p><p>As an unseeded player, Murray was at the complete mercy of the draw. Throughout the rest of the summer, he attempted to rectify that issue by piling tournaments on to his schedule – he immediately travelled to Rhode Island to compete in the Hall of Fame Open, the lowly tournament that ends the grass-court season. After the considerable feat of returning to the top 50, though, Murray could not push on and secure a top-32 spot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/15/andy-murray-matteo-berrettini-australian-open">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nature writer whose 1969 book Akenfield, a portrait of a rural life rapidly disappearing from view, was acclaimed as a classic</p><p>In the summer of 1967, Ronald Blythe cycled from his home in the Suffolk hamlet of Debach to the neighbouring village of Charlsfield. There he listened to the voices of blacksmiths, gravediggers, nurses, horsemen and pig farmers. He gave them names from gravestones and placed them in a fictional village. Akenfield, a portrait of a rural life rapidly disappearing from view, was immediately acclaimed as a classic when it was published in 1969.</p><p>Never out of print and read and studied around the world, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/24/akenfield-revisited-english-country-life">Akenfield</a> made Blythe famous and perhaps overshadowed the many other fruits of his long years of writing – short stories, poems, histories, novels and, in later life, luminous essays and a superb weekly diary which the Church Times published for 25 years until 2017. Blythe, who has died aged 100, is regarded by his peers and many readers as the finest contemporary writer on the English countryside.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/15/ronald-blythe-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Led by a manager who is treading water, Tottenham are going nowhere, while their derby rivals kick on with commitment</p><p>After the final whistle, after the booing and brawling had subsided, as Arsenal’s giddy players jigged and danced their way over to their supporters in the corner, Yves Bissouma stood alone in the Tottenham half watching them. Watching with longing, and envy, and perhaps even a certain curiosity. Joy? Pleasure? Celebration? What are these strange new things?</p><p>By that stage, of course, Bissouma’s teammates had long since retired to the warmth of the dressing room. They did not want to be there any longer, and nor did the Tottenham fans who were already slogging down the High Road in search of liquid consolation. Antonio Conte, as he never tires of telling us, does still want to be here. Ideally. Providing several important conditions are met. It can hardly be his fault, after all, that the club keeps disappointing him like this.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/15/spurs-and-contes-lack-of-fervour-thrown-into-stark-relief-by-arsenal">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Racing 92 30-29 Harlequins</li><li>40m kick wins match despite Racing being down to 12 men</li></ul><p>Harlequins had victory snatched away from them in dramatic style even though they were playing against 12 Racing 92 players at the time. The French side, three times runners-up in the Heineken Champions Cup, looked dead and buried when they conceded a penalty try in the 75th minute and lost their talisman Finn Russell, who was sent to the sin-bin.</p><p>The departure of the Scottish playmaker made it three yellow cards in as many minutes for Racing, and they found themselves behind for the first time in the match at 29-27. Despite being three men down, they managed to gather the restart, after which Harlequins’ André Esterhuizen was penalised for not releasing. That gave Nolann Le Garrec the chance to step into the goalkicking shoes of Russell and win the match. He hit the mark from 40 metres with his penalty and Racing were able to play out the final three minutes to win by a point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/15/racing-92-harlequins-heinken-champions-cup-match-report-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fashion label has taken items you might already own – a white vest, a backpack – for its menswear show</p><p>No one comes to Milan fashion week for its “useful clothes”. Yet this was the verdict of director Luca Guadagnino, who sat in the front row on Sunday’s menswear show: “Useful, yes, wearable, yes, all those things. Everyone can wear this.”</p><p>Price-tags aside, his point was this: just as in previous collections, Prada took things you might already own – a ribbed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/16/testing-out-prada-white-vest-simon-hattenstone">white vest</a>, a backpack – and turned them into must-have pieces. They did the same with Duffle coats, donkey jackets, black office brogues and navy parkas. Sometimes fashion holds up a mirror to what’s happening in the world, but sometimes it reminds us of what we already own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/15/prada-toes-line-between-useful-and-zany-at-milan-fashion-week">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rory Kinnear is brilliant in this warming comedy about a Burnley businessman who took on London’s elite and won</p><p>Here is the latest film to roll off the production line of cheerful warming British underdog comedies. As originally showcased in a 2012 Channel 4 series, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jul/12/why-i-opened-bank-of-dave">it is the true story</a> of how self-made Burnley businessman Dave Fishwick took on London’s elite banking institutions to get a licence to open his own bank serving the local community. More accurately, this film is a heavily fictionalised version of that story, slickly packaged into a familiar formula by the team behind <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/13/fishermans-friends-review-seaswept-britcom-reels-in-the-laughs">Fisherman’s Friends</a>.</p><p>Rory Kinnear is brilliant as Fishwick, who made his fortune selling vans and minibuses but has never forgotten his roots. Kinnear gives the character a winning mix of down-to-earth blokiness with a rags-to-riches flamboyance (and a bit of ego to match the flash car). The film opens in the wake of the 2008 financial crash: Fishwick’s customers are struggling to borrow from the high street, so he’s started lending them money. But to operate as a bank he needs a licence, and the Eton poshos regulating the banking sector decide he’s not the right sort of chap.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/15/bank-of-dave-review-underdog-story-of-an-everyman-v-eton-poshos">Continue reading...</a>

## Havertz’s header for Chelsea sinks Crystal Palace to ease pressure on Potter

<p>On a day when the memory of the late, great Gianluca Vialli acted as a unifying force, it felt imperative for Chelsea’s players to show pride in the badge. Anything less would have been a betrayal. The fans simply wanted evidence of some heart, anything to suggest that this underperforming squad is not trying to force out another manager, and the end result was that Graham Potter could feel the pressure on his shoulders lightening by the time this frayed contest was over.</p><p>The relief was immense when Kai Havertz, accepting the responsibility that comes with a £62m fee, barrelled in a brilliant header midway through the second half. Havertz’s sixth goal of the season had calmed the noise. It brought Chelsea only their second win in 10 league games and, although it took some fine saves from Kepa Arrizabalaga to keep Crystal Palace at bay, victory at least gives Potter some breathing space.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/15/chelsea-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Canadian author’s debut novel, about a circus troupe travelling by steam train across war-torn Europe, is a vivid, uplifting page-turner</p><p>In her impeccably researched debut, which opens in 1938, the Canadian author <a href="https://www.amitaparikh.com/about">Amita Parikh</a> weaves a hypnotic tale about a circus troupe travelling through Europe on a luxury steam train. Lena Papadopoulos’s father, Theo, is a Greek illusionist with “the showmanship of [Harry] Houdini, the skill of [David] Devant and the intelligence of [Harry] Kellar”. He’s the headline act of the World of Wonders circus. Having contracted polio as a baby, Lena uses a wheelchair. She is friendless until a French Jewish boy, Alexandre, is discovered unconscious onboard the train. Theo persuades Horace, the circus’s self-serving American owner, to allow Alexandre, an orphan, to stay, promising to school him in the art of illusion.</p><p>Lena studies hard with a private governess and finds herself increasingly drawn to the world of science and medicine. Together with her doctor, she explores the possibility of regaining mobility in her legs. As her friendship with Alexandre fizzes into something more, the dark clouds of war threaten to envelop everything she has worked so hard for. The SS increasingly patrol the train, and Horace strikes a dangerous deal with them that will shatter their fragile peace.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/15/the-circus-train-by-amita-parikh-review-magic-and-brutality-in-the-shadow-of-war">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A late header from Chelsea’s Sam Kerr denied a dominant but toothless Arsenal victory in a feisty battle with the Women’s Super League leaders at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners looked to have closed the three-point gap on their London rivals at the top of the table, with Chelsea having played a game more, thanks to a Kim Little penalty before the hour, but Kerr needed just one moment to draw the beleaguered Blues level.</p><p>With 46,811 tickets sold, more than 40,000 had come for the third time to watch the women’s team in the WSL this season, though there were hordes of fans stranded outside as the game kicked off. Arsenal said in a statement that the match-day operation was the same as it is for every fixture at the ground, blaming “an early kick-off combined with a number of new supporters to our stadium, coupled with 50% of supporters arriving in the last 20 minutes before kick-off” for the overwhelmed turnstiles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/15/arsenal-chelsea-womens-super-league-match-report-wsl">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Finding it ‘fragile’ and ‘gross’, femininity was something Ione Gamble refused to conform to. Then she was diagnosed with a disease which changed everything</p><p>I have always been a girl’s girl. But as a teenager I tried to fight it, intent on the fact I was not like other girls, morally superior to those who spent their days fawning over the latest It bag from Miss Selfridge. It was only as I entered adulthood, and was diagnosed with an incurable illness, that embracing the femininity I had pretended to hate started to make any sense to me.</p><p>All through my adolescence femininity was presented as something to belittle, berate or outright mock, with tabloids tearing apart teen pop icons and painting any high-profile woman with blonde hair as a bimbo.

<p>(Polydor)<br />The London rapper veers between vulnerable and vicious on a mixtape that’s at once epic and pared back</p><p>“I don’t care about being in the charts,” offers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/03/new-music-for-2023-clavish-the-quiet-london-rapper">Clavish</a> towards the end of this epic, 28-track mixtape. “But if I am, I’m thankful,” he quickly counters. You don’t sign to the world’s largest record company by accident, though, and the north London rapper has been carefully nurtured for success over the past two years, along the lines of billion-stream, award-winning mentors Dave and Stormzy. Now that UK rap has fully flowered into a wide range of popular styles and personalities, there’s room for a truculent, technically gifted rapper who appears ambivalent about his chosen career.</p><p>Picture Clavish as Distracted Boyfriend in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/distracted-boyfriend-meme-sexist-swedish-advertising">timeless meme</a>. His girlfriend is the rap game, and the girl passing by is gang life, with its opps, knives, guns, drugs, faithless women and disappointed mums. He spends most of these 90 minutes poring over his bad behaviour with much wit, if little humour. <em>Rap Game Awful</em> could be less monotone – recent Top 10 hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OWJiO4RGGQ">Rocket Science</a> benefits hugely from Young Adz’s alien Auto-Tune coos. Yet the chill, sparse productions foreground Clavish’s economical delivery beautifully, as he flirts with imploring vulnerability and vicious querulousness without ever committing to either. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/15/clavish-rap-game-awful-review-beautifully-delivered-ambivalence-rocket-science">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former Sex Pistol competing to represent Ireland with love letter to wife of 44 years who is living with the illness</p><p>John Lydon has said he is competing to represent Ireland at this year’s Eurovision song contest primarily in order to raise awareness of Alzheimer’s disease. The former Sex Pistols frontman (once known as Johnny Rotten) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/09/john-lydons-public-image-ltd-compete-to-represent-ireland-at-eurovision">will appear with his band, Public Image Ltd, on the Late Late Show on 3 February</a>, performing Hawaii, a love letter to his wife of 44 years, Nora Forster, who is living with the illness.</p><p>“I’m doing it to highlight the sheer torture of what Alzheimer’s is,” said the singer, who holds an Irish passport as well as US citizenship. “It gets swept under the carpet, but in highlighting it, hopefully we get a stage nearer to a cure.” Lydon insisted that spreading this message was much more important than competing to win, so he isn’t listening to the five other entrants. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/15/john-lydon-hopes-to-highlight-torture-of-alzheimers-with-eurovision-bid">Continue reading...</a>

## Britain’s excess death rate is at a disastrous high – and the causes go far beyond Covid | Owen Jones

<p>A deadly, avoidable crisis is under way, fuelled by NHS cuts, the neglect of social care, inequality and the soaring cost of living</p><p>When most people hear that phrase “humanitarian crisis”, they think “abroad”, “somewhere far away”, and certainly not in Britain. But how else to describe the tens of thousands of bodies avoidably piling up in the nation’s mortuaries? One funeral home worker says that they’ve run out of spaces for the deceased and “are having to keep some encoffined in office rooms”; another hospital porter reports that the mortuary has been near capacity for two weeks. This national issue should be splashed on every front page and leading every bulletin. It isn’t: why?</p><p>Last year in the UK there were <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/excess-deaths-reach-highest-level-since-pandemic-peak-how-much-are-nhs-failings-to-blame-12780446">nearly 40,000 excess deaths</a> – that is, deaths above a five-year average. That’s nearly as many as were killed by the Luftwaffe in the blitz. In the last two weeks of 2022, deaths were a fifth higher than the average from 2016 to 2019 (the last pre-pandemic year), and that’s taking into account factors such as a bigger, ageing population. </p><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/15/britain-excess-death-rate-covid-nhs-cost-of-living">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Decades after I first glimpsed French Elle and dreamed of my future chicness, I have passed my citizenship exam. It feels like a genuine privilege</p><p>I have wanted to be French since I was 16 and found French Elle magazine in the school library, with its adolescent catnip combination of lipstick, serious books and films featuring Daniel Auteuil brooding alluringly. The celebrity “my day” feature provided me with highly specific visions of Frenchness to aspire to: one day, I, too, would rise at noon for an espresso and a <em>marron glacé</em>, dress in Chanel and work on my creative projects, only breaking to eat oysters and smoke on a cafe terrace with one or more of my lovers. Thirty-two years later, approaching five years back living in England, fatally unchic, addicted to tea, vegetarian stodge and lowbrow television, I am finally French.</p><p>It feels unfair, like cheating. Married to a Frenchman, with the resources to pay for the translations, French test and trips from York down to London, the main obstacles I faced were Covid-related cancellations and my own administrative incompetence. But for most applicants, citizenship is – deliberately – arduous, an impenetrable, obstacle-strewn maze. It’s not me saying that, it’s the French <a href="https://www.defenseurdesdroits.fr/en/an-independent-institution#:~:text=The%20Defender%20of%20Rights%20is,the%20exercise%20of%20his%20office.">Defender of Rights</a> (an independent authority that “ensures respect for rights and freedoms”). Its <a href="https://www.defenseurdesdroits.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/ddd_rapport_devenir-francais-par-naturalisation_20220209.pdf">2022 report</a> describes the process as “full of pitfalls”, with refugees, elderly people and those without a stable address (inevitably poorer people) left behind. Not just them: my sister, who has worked in a refuge for vulnerable people in Paris for years, had her application rejected on a technicality. She’s reapplying, but pessimistic. The situation for would-be citizens is much worse here in the UK (and the mere existence of a “defender of rights” holding the authorities to account is refreshing), but the <em>égalité </em>bit of the French national motto feels strained.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/15/i-am-finally-french-after-years-of-longing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The travel writer’s quest for spiritual transcendence takes him from Iran to North Korea in a book that rarely illuminates the people he encounters</p><p>Having been an obsessive traveller most of his life, beginning with termly commutes to Eton from his Indian parents’ home in California, Pico Iyer has lately been documenting the virtues of sitting still. A <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/pico_iyer_the_art_of_stillness">2014 Ted Talk</a> outlined the advantages – spiritual, environmental – of lying back and thinking of old pilgrimages or of nothing at all. This book is a mix of restlessness and the couch; it sees the author reporting on and recalling journeys through some of the world’s most divided and chaotic places – Kashmir, Jerusalem, Sri Lanka, North Korea among others – mostly in search of a bit of peace and quiet.</p><p>Iyer, now 65, has always been in thrall to clouds of unknowing, prizing glimpses of the ethereal in remote corners, clocking up air miles and epiphanies. He spent some time with Leonard Cohen in the five years he was a Zen Buddhist monk at Mount Baldy, near Los Angeles. He has been a friend and confidant of the Dalai Lama since they met at Dharamshala in 1974. He has often given the impression of a peripatetic personal Buddhism, without too much of the suffering. This particular quest – in search of the idea of paradise in the midst of political complication – is something of a summation of that roving life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/15/the-half-known-life-by-pico-iyer-review-peace-and-quiet-in-political-hotspots">Continue reading...</a>

But in March 2022, the number of new research papers by the LHC experiments fell to zero. The reason: a lack of agreement on how to list Russian and Belarusian scientists and institutes, if at all. The temporary compromise, in place up to now, is not to publish.</p><p>Publications are the hard currency of research, used for exchange of information and evidence of individuals’ and funding agencies’ contributions.

The telltale signs of allergy had plagued my daughter since she was a newborn: the “colic”; the eczema that weeped and crusted despite the cocktail of steroid creams; the hives that erupted at random across her tiny face and eyes. I knew as I mixed peanut butter into her breakfast that morning there was a possibility that things could be about to go sideways. But what I didn’t know was just how much our lives were about to change.</p><p>Discovering she was severely allergic to peanuts when she was six months old was just the first piece of the puzzle.

Those with experience of parenting allergic children will know what I mean when I say it’s almost broken me.

<p>Drummer, lawyer, composer, politician… Blur’s busiest member on the troubled childhood that influenced his new solo album, Radio Songs, and the band’s summer reunion gigs</p><p>A couple of weeks before Christmas, and the planning meetings have just finished for two of 2023’s most anticipated gigs, by a British band who first rehearsed together 35 years ago. In July, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/blur">Blur</a> are due to play two nights at the 90,000-capacity Wembley Stadium (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/14/blur-to-reunite-for-one-off-wembley-show-next-year">only one concert was originally scheduled</a>, but it sold out in two minutes). Their blend of ideas from British pop culture’s past, mixed with the peculiar optimism at the end of the last century, made them one of the biggest bands of the 1990s; they’ve only made two albums since, both of them tentative, tender but lovely: 2003’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/may/04/popandrock.artsfeatures">Think Tank</a></em> and 2015’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/26/blur-magic-whip-review-different-creature-predecessors">The Magic Whip</a></em>. </p><p>The day before I meet the band’s drummer, Dave Rowntree, he was with singer Albarn, guitarist Graham Coxon and bassist Alex James in an undisclosed location in London, plotting the rough shape of the Wembley gigs, with instruments on their laps. “It was good! This is the fun bit before we’re playing the set over and over and over again, staring sullenly at our phones between songs,” Rowntree tells me. On this bright winter morning he is at Tate Modern in London’s Bankside wearing a hoodie and carrying bags of the clothes he has just worn for the <em>Observer’s</em> photoshoot. He had his portrait taken in the gallery next to <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/meireles-babel-t14041">Cildo Meireles’s </a><em><a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/meireles-babel-t14041">Babel</a></em><a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/meireles-babel-t14041">,</a> a murmuring, ominous tower of a sculpture that he’s always loved, made up of hundreds of analogue radios. Oblivious ageing hipsters and midlifers, who will definitely have danced to his drumbeats, pass him by. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/15/blur-dave-rowntree-interview-radio-songs-album-wembley-reunion-gigs">Continue reading...</a>

## Twenty-six courses, £400 bills, artichoke creme brulee… I won’t miss fine dining | Jay Rayner

<p>Top restaurants such as Noma are closing. They were fun for a while but we’ve had our fill</p><p>In 2007, for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Man-Who-Ate-World-Perfect/dp/0755316355/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=jay+rayner&amp;qid=1673599838&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-4">a book</a> on the world’s luxury restaurant economy, I undertook what I called the high-end <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/dec/31/dvdreviews1">Super</a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/dec/31/dvdreviews1"> Size Me</a></em>. In the 2004 documentary, Morgan Spurlock ate McDonald’s every day for a month to see how it would affect his body. The high-end version involved me eating in a Parisian Michelin three-star restaurant every day for a week. Back then, talking about this stunt felt like a boast; now, it feels like a confession.</p><p>I won’t pretend it was all terrible. There was an extraordinary pea dish at Restaurant Guy Savoy, which elevated the humble legume to god-tier status; at the tiny L’Astrance, there was the most spectacular chilled tomato soup. But for all these bright spots there were also disasters: langoustines on sticks wrapped in brackish sea-water foam at Ledoyen, an appalling artichoke creme brulee at Le Grand Véfour that was split. But what really stayed with me from my grotesque endurance feat was the unreality of this kind of high-end restaurant: it’s grim, preening, massively unenjoyable artifice. And if a meal out isn’t enjoyable, what’s the point of it? My love affair with the finest of fine dining began to crumble.</p><p>Jay Rayner is the Observer’s restaurant critic</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/15/twenty-six-courses-400-bills-artichoke-creme-brulee-i-wont-miss-fine-dining">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This predictable tale of a vengeful gunslinger is redeemed by the moving father-daughter dynamic between Cage and Ryan Kiera Armstrong</p><p>A grizzled frontier shopkeeper must draw on his outlaw gunslinger past to avenge the murder of his wife, in this generic western retread. The key to the approach is in the title – there’s a timeworn predictability in everything from the plot (variations of this story have been told many times before, most recently in the superior <em>Old Henry</em>) to the big, expansive, Alfred Newman-inspired score, to the widescreen wild west backdrop.</p><p>Two elements make the picture worth watching: one is Nicolas Cage, wearily brutal as Colton Briggs, a man who has already completed a lifetime’s worth of killing. The other is Ryan Kiera Armstrong, playing his 12-year-old daughter Brooke, a chip off the old block. Both Colton and Brooke struggle to manifest the “normal’ emotional responses. Their revenge is coolly efficient; their relationship – the only unconventional element in the picture – is angular, uncomfortable and unexpectedly affecting.</p><p>In cinemas and on digital platforms</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/15/the-old-way-review-generic-western-nicolas-cage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>By braving some of the most forbidding waters on the planet, Lewis Pugh uses his unique brand of ‘Speedo diplomacy’ to draw the attention of the world’s leaders to the devastating effects of global warming. Here, he talks about extreme cold, coral reefs – and taming his inner wolf </p><p>Lewis Pugh typically starts to plan his next extreme-swimming challenge after just enough time has passed for him to have forgotten how deeply unpleasant the last one was. He opens his atlas – I know! An atlas! – and turns the pages until he finds a body of water that captures his imagination. “I’m flicking through and I think, ‘Can I swim around this cape?’” says Pugh, who is 53, and has been testing the limits of human endurance for 35 years wearing just a silicone cap and a pair of Speedos. “Can I swim down this river? Can I cross this ocean? Can I cross this bay? Where can I shine a light on a place? Where can I tell a story?”</p><p>When his next venture finally comes to him, Pugh notes, it is never an “aha moment”, but almost always an “err-duh moment” – something glaringly obvious. “I’m agonising, agonising and it’s not quite right and then suddenly” – Pugh claps his hands – “it was right in front of me. ‘Err-duh! Why did I not think of that?’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/15/extreme-swimmer-lewis-pugh-the-polar-regions-are-the-ground-zero-of-the-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This enjoyable horror-lite romp follows in the killer doll footsteps of Chucky and Annabelle </p><p>M3gan is the ultimate prestige toy: a precision-engineered prototype cyborg doll with limpid blue eyes and the capacity to learn from and empathise with her “primary user”. She comes with a price tag that would buy you a midsized family car, a full gamut of judgmental tweenager eye rolls and a taste for casual slaughter. And right now, she’s a lifeline for her creator, robotics engineer Gemma (Allison Williams). Following the deaths of her sister and brother-in-law, Gemma finds herself caring for her traumatised eight-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw). It’s a job that Gemma is only too happy to outsource to Frankenstein’s 4ft devil Barbie, a decision that comes back to bite her (and to attack her with a hammer).</p><p>The latest addition to the killer doll genre, M3gan is an enjoyable horror-lite romp: knowing, amusing, but not particularly scary. But while the psychotically perky robot might not have the chaotic energy of Chucky from the <em>Child’s Play</em> franchise or the porcelain malevolence of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/04/the-queen-of-evil-dolls-why-annabelles-work-ethic-makes-her-a-great-role-model">Annabelle</a>, she does bring a pleasing TikTok-friendly pizazz to her killing rampages.

<p>Brilliantly hued stalks of chard and rhubarb to brighten up meals</p><p>I have arrived back from the shops with a tangle of stalks in my bag. Thick ribs of rhubarb the colour of seaside rock; crisp green puntarelle for a salad and a bunch of rainbow chard the colour of wine gums. The puntarelle will be trimmed and the long, pale stems tossed with mashed anchovies and olive oil, but the others need a bit more thought.</p><p>The chard was bought on a whim – I am a pushover for their long ruby and apricot stems. I think of chard as two vegetables in one, the leaves that are like tough spinach and the white and multicoloured stalks that are delicious enough if you toss them in melted butter and lemon juice after steaming. This time, I dressed the stalks with the sort of ingredients I might use to sauce fried prawns or make into a marinade for roasted chicken thighs: piercingly hot little chillies, lime juice, fish sauce and honey.

<p>In their new book, the novelist and his photographer son-in-law document the sites of mass shootings in the US and argue for urgent change in the relationship between Americans and guns</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/15/paul-auster-bloodbath-nation-read-extract-guns-america">Bloodbath Nation extract: ‘The gun that killed my grandfather was the same gun that ruined my father’s life’</a></li></ul><p><strong>How did the book </strong><em><strong>Bloodbath Nation</strong></em><strong> come about?<br /></strong>My son-in-law, <a href="https://spencerostrander.com/contact">the photographer Spencer Ostrander,</a> came to me one day very upset about the gun violence he was seeing all around him – as a decent human being would be. He said he’d decided to start travelling around the country, photographing the sites of all the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2021/may/27/us-mass-shootings-database">mass shootings</a> in the past 20 years. As I say in the book, mass shootings account for just a small fraction of American gun deaths, but they nevertheless occur with stunning frequency – roughly one per day over the course of any given year. Spencer made a series of long-distance excursions over the course of two-and-a-half years and finally took pictures of 30 to 40 places. When he showed them to me, I said: ‘“I think these are very, very compelling photos, and maybe if you put them together as some kind of book, I could write a text to go with it.” It was just an idea at that point and as it evolved, it became a kind of dialogue between us – the word man and the picture man.</p><p><strong>What do you think makes Spencer’s photographs so eloquent?<br /></strong>I think the absence of human figures is striking and the way that there are no guns, no reference to mass shootings, just these often rather ugly buildings in the middle of rather nondescript, depressing American landscapes. There’s an emptiness to them. I don’t want to get too pompous about it but I think that emptiness does reflect the emptiness of this world we’ve created in which people are slaughtered with so little effect on the life of the country. We all get upset, we all complain, and yet things stay the same. And the gun lobby remains very, very strong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/15/paul-auster-right-own-gun-us-bloodbath-nation-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## The Holocaust: An Unfinished History by Dan Stone review – a timely corrective to a shifting narrative

<p>An erudite account of the Nazi genocide reiterates neglected truths and exposes modern attempts to rewrite the facts</p><p>In many ways, writes historian Dan Stone, “we have failed unflinchingly to face the terrible reality of the Holocaust”. His remarkable book offers both a narrative overview and an analysis of the events, challenging many common assumptions and often returning to how this terrible history remains “unfinished”.</p><p>Some recent scholarly studies of the Holocaust, Stone argues, have stressed “the reactive nature of German decision-making, driven primarily by military circumstance”. He does not dispute the importance of contingent factors, such as rivalries between different Nazi factions, or how the leadership ramped up the level of persecution after the public largely failed to object to the <em>Kristallnacht</em><em> </em>pogrom of November 1938 and then the T-4 euthanasia programme. But he also puts a firm emphasis on “ideology, understood as a kind of phantasmagorical conspiracy theory, as the kernel of Nazi thinking and action”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/15/the-holocaust-an-unfinished-history-by-dan-stone-review-a-timely-corrective-to-a-shifting-narrative">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor and presenter on saying goodbye to Derry Girls, her role in Disney’s new superhero comedy Extraordinary, and why she’s been given her own ‘infant’ table on Pottery Throw Down</p><p>The actor and presenter Siobhán McSweeney, 43, grew up in the village of Aherla, County Cork. After completing a science degree at University College Cork, she moved to London to study at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Her breakthrough role was as Sister Michael in the sitcom <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/derry-girls">Derry Girls</a></em>. She is currently hosting <em><a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-great-pottery-throw-down">The Great Pottery Throw Down</a></em> and next appears in the Disney+ superhero comedy series <em>Extraordinary</em>.</p><p><strong>You were on crutches during last year’s </strong><em><strong>Pottery Throw Down</strong></em><strong> after a bike crash which broke your leg in two places. You seem thrilled to be back and crutch-free for the new series…<br /></strong>That’s because I’m on strong painkillers [laughs]. No, I’m genuinely excited. Gladstone Pottery [in Stoke-on-Trent, where the series is filmed] isn’t built for crutches and I was in so much pain. I had to miss a few episodes and felt like I’d let everyone down. So it’s absolute bliss to be back. I’m not that good an actor to fake how much fun we have.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/15/siobhan-mcsweeney-great-pottery-throwdown-derry-girls-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The hard-right religious coalition is attacking civil liberties at home and becoming an unreliable partner abroad.

<p>A lone wildlife volunteer on an island off the coast of Cornwall is haunted by the past and the landscape in the writer-director’s spellbinding follow-up to Bait</p><p>Film-maker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/27/mark-jenkin-interview-enys-men">Mark Jenkin</a> originally intended to brand his superbly haunting follow-up to <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/01/bait-review-mark-jenkin-cornish-fishing-village">Bait</a></em> (2019) as “a lost Cornish folk horror” film. He was persuaded to drop most of those descriptions: <em>Enys Men</em> isn’t lost (although it <em>does</em> feel like a recently unearthed magical relic from another era); it isn’t really horror (despite that ultra-creepy trailer); and the word “folk” is oddly misleading. That left “a Cornish film” – a simple phrase that perfectly encapsulates the myriad mysteries soaked into the dreamy, tactile landscape of this handmade gem. I <em>could </em>tell you that <em>Enys Men</em> (which means Stone Island) is Shirley Jackson’s <em>The Haunting of Hill </em><em>House</em> as reimagined by the ghost of Nic Roeg; that it’s the cult 70s TV frightener <em>The Stone Tape</em> reconfigured through the inspirational prism of playwright and environmental activist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/15/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries">Nick Darke</a>; or that it owes more to the Japanese chiller <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCPEJ982dxo">Onibaba</a></em> than to the “unholy trinity” of British folk-horror (<em>Witchfinder General</em><em>, </em><em>The Blood on Satan’s Claw</em> and <em>The Wicker Man</em>). But the more I think about it, the more “a Cornish film” says it all.</p><p>It’s easier to describe <em>Enys Men</em> in terms of colour (red and yellow are primal elements) than plot, since its distinct brand of clockwork-cranked, luxuriously saturated cinematic poetry is supremely resistant to precis. Suffice to say that it plays out on an island off the Cornish coast in the days before May Day, 1973. Mary Woodvine is quietly mesmerising as the unnamed volunteer stationed alone on the island, although as she says: “I’m not on my own.” Her life is ritual: walking the rugged cliffs, taking temperature readings around an outcrop of rare flowers; listening to a stone drop down a mineshaft; writing the day’s findings (“no change”) in her botanical diary. Back at the cottage, she fires up the growling generator (fuel supplies are low), makes the tea (also running out), and takes to bed with a copy of <em>A Blueprint for Survival</em>, an environmentalist text whose cover is emblazoned with the promise that after reading it “nothing quite seems the same any more”. The same could be said of this film.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/15/enys-men-review-mark-jenkin-cornish-psychodrama-will-sweep-you-away">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Cluttercore’ is an addictive reponse to minimalism, but what’s really interesting about it is the endlessly weird relationship we all have with our stuff – or lack of it</p><p>There is a picture pinned beside my desk, a grid showing nine photographs of the same room. In the first photo there is a single bed, a clock, a lamp, two posters. It looks like maybe a student halls of residence – there is the feeling of homesickness and lack.</p><p>In the second picture some rubbish sits on the carpet, the kind of stuff you’d tip out of a rucksack when repacking in a hurry. One poster is wonky. In the third, a chair has joined the room, and a pile of papers, and discarded clothes. In the fifth, a television is just visible beside a second chair, I think I see some speakers, a bundle of sheets. In the ninth and final photo, the bed is hidden beneath a mountain of clothes that touches the ceiling, a broken blind, a large bottle of something red and presumably fizzy. This is the Clutter Image Rating scale, a diagnostic tool designed to measure hoarding habits, and it has somehow become very important to me in the time since I printed it out at work and carefully carried it home inside a book, both as an image and as an evergreen template for the domestic horror stories of our lives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/15/have-we-finally-made-peace-with-our-clutter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The wave of public sector strikes will only get worse until the government realises that compromise is not a dirty word</p><p>As the legendary political thinker Zsa Zsa Gabor once put it: “Macho does not prove mucho.” Faced with the most disruptive combination of industrial action in essential services in decades, the first instinct of Rishi Sunak and his cabinet was to put on muscle suits, beat their silicone chests and declare that they would tough it out. Ministers refused to come to the negotiating table with the unions while dismissing every pay claim as unaffordable. They adopted this uncompromising posture in the belief that time would be their ally and the enemy of those withdrawing their labour in protest at the squeeze on the real value of their incomes.</p><p>One of the cabinet’s key assumptions was that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/winter-of-discontent-harden-feeling-tories-have-broken-britain">public sympathy</a> for strikers would ebb as people began to suffer the consequences. The other calculation among ministers was that the resolve of strikers would fray. Infused with an archaic nostalgia for the epic battles waged between the Thatcher government and trade unions in the 1980s, a lot of Tories even thought that widespread industrial unrest would rebound to their party’s advantage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/15/if-rishi-sunak-doesnt-drop-the-macho-act-were-in-for-a-spring-of-continuing-misery">Continue reading...</a>

And could a new alcohol substitute really give us a risk-free buzz?</p><p>Cheers and mazel tov! We’ve made it halfway through January. Yes, our bodies endured a pounding through the festive frivolities, but through that excruciating cumulative hangover we somehow survived. Our recycling bins have been collected, those bottles of bubbly out of sight and mind. New-year-new-me resolutions can now be abandoned. Anyone fancy a pint?</p><p>Or this year, does another round feel less appealing? You’re far from alone if, in 2023, you’re considering calling time once and for all. Welcome to the era of the sober-<br />curious; the apparently ever-growing movement of people exploring what life could look like alcohol-free. Among young Brits, the numbers look irrefutable: between 2002 and 2019, the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds in England who reported monthly drinking fell from 67% to 41%. And while the stats don’t show older adults <br />putting down the plonk on a permanent basis, something is shifting. According to Dry January’s organisers, this year one in six UK adults who drink alcohol are attempting to participate. Alcohol-free beers were once a fringe choice; today they’re found nationwide on supermarket shelves. No longer do 0% orders come with a side of pregnancy questions or bemused stares.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/15/last-orders-how-we-fell-out-of-love-with-alcohol">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Richard E Grant’s late wife, Joan Washington, knew the right moments to recall her Aberdonian roots. Sometimes it’s all about delivery</p><p>The news that Richard E Grant’s late wife, the renowned dialect coach Joan Washington, used to assume an Aberdonian accent whenever she wanted to haggle over a potential purchase, is enough to make you drop your aitches. But what offensive masquerading, what terrible pigeonholing, is this? And then you discover that it was not an impersonation, but a reversion: Washington was returning to the inflections of her Granite City youth, before life as a drama student in London prompted her to adopt received pronunciation (ie, home counties posh). If she thought it was fine to go full Scottish to intimidate antiques dealers who believed that her countrymen and women know how to drive a hard bargain, then who am I (blandly SE England, madly jealous of regional accents) to object?</p><p>It all depends on where you’re standing. The very first line of a piece I read on an Irish website when the trailer for <em>The Banshees of Inisherin</em> first hit the screens queried whether Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell and Barry Keoghan, all three of them Dubliners, would be able to carry off west of Ireland voices.

<p>The author of the hit Cairo-set novel – set to be a future classic – on going viral with her first web comic and growing up reading Enid Blyton and Agatha Christie</p><p>When Deena Mohamed tells me that her grandmother, keen to encourage her love of art, used to let her draw on the backs of old cigarette cartons as a girl, it feels strangely significant. Mohamed’s new graphic novel, after all, is inspired by the <em>koshks</em> (kiosks) that can be found on every Cairo street corner: beloved, Tardis-like stands that make it possible to buy, among many other things, tobacco at any hour of the day or night. To me, <em>Your Wish Is My Command</em> now feels more than ever like the book she was born to write: a future classic that may one day be spoken of in the same breath as Craig Thompson’s <em><a href="https://theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/11/blankets-craig-thompson-review#:~:text=While%20the%20young%20artist%20is,passionate%20account%20of%20growing%20up.">Blankets</a></em>, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/09/protests-iran-persepolis-graphic-novel-marjane-satrapi">Marjane Satrapi</a>’s <em>Persepolis</em>.</p><p>Originally published in three volumes as <em>Shubeik Lubeik</em> in Arabic, and the winner of the Grand Prize at the 2017 Cairo Comix festival, <em>Your Wish Is My Command</em> is set in an all too recognisable modern-day Egypt: here is heavy traffic, and even heavier bureaucracy. But the Cairo Mohamed depicts, noisy and teeming, isn’t precisely the place in which she was born and still lives (though we’re talking on Zoom, alas). In this city, as in those across the rest of the world, wishes can literally be bought, and thus, lives changed for ever, overnight. There is, however, a catch (you knew there would be). These precious wishes, stored in bottles and carefully controlled by the state, vary in quality, and access to first-class ones, the only truly reliable kind, is restricted either to the rich or to the extremely lucky – until, that is, a man called Shokry, the owner of an unassuming kiosk, puts three of them on sale.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/15/deena-mohamed-your-wish-is-my-command-graphic-novel-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## Spare by Prince Harry review – dry your eyes, mate

<p>For all he may have suffered, and despite his clear love for his wife, the Duke of Sussex’s misfiring memoir is not only tone-deaf to his privilege but at times downright bizarre</p><p>It’s now almost a week since Prince Harry’s memoir <em>Spare </em>was published and what thrillingly hectic days they’ve been: hard to pick a highlight. Amusing as it was to find Nicholas Witchell reporting for the BBC on the book’s release by filming the sole person queueing outside Waterstones’ London flagship to buy it, I think the sound of the ex-<em>Sun</em> hack Dan Wootton railing flatulently in the <em>Daily Mail</em> at Harry’s description of him as a “sad little man” just edged it for me (“no, YOU’RE the sad little man, Mister Prince!”). Meanwhile, in the US, Harry went on <em>The Late Show </em><em>With Stephen Colbert</em>, where he performed a skit with some trumpets and Tom Hanks and spoke of his “frost-nipped todger” – said todger being, by the way, just one of dozens of be-nicknamed rude mechanicals who appear in his masterwork (others include his mates Badger, Skippy and Chimp; the venomous royal courtiers known as the Bee, the Wasp and the Fly; and Rehabber Kooks, AKA Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of Rupert Murdoch’s News UK).</p><p>It has to be said, however, that none of this coverage, barmy and excessively fixated, is even half so unlikely as <em>Spare </em>itself, a book that must rank as one of the most bizarre I’ve ever read. Yes, it is – at moments – very sad. There’s ongoing shame in it for tabloid journalism. But for a title written explicitly in the cause of securing sympathy and understanding for its so-called author, boy, does it misfire. It’s not only that Harry is so petulant: a man who thinks nothing, even now, of complaining about the bedroom he was allotted for his summer hols in Granny’s castle. With every page, his California makeover grows less convincing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/15/spare-by-prince-harry-review-dry-your-eyes-mate">Continue reading...</a>

Outwardly, publicly, I can say my life has been interesting and successful. I’ve had a good career.

I feel blessed. And yet I am haunted by a loss that I find difficult to comprehend. I have not seen my children for years.

That may have little meaning for the majority of parents today, but the proper place for institutions outside the family in the birth and rearing of our children is a pressing matter indeed. And recent evidence suggests that government is grievously failing parents in many ways.</p><p>It starts even before birth. A new report, out last week from the Care Quality Commission (CQC), highlighted a <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/press-release/national-survey-shows-decline-positive-maternity-experiences">worrying decline in women’s experiences</a> of NHS maternity services in England . The trend comes in the wake of a number of inquiries into the appallingly poor maternity care on offer in some hospital trusts; it is estimated that <a href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/a4eg2xnm/ebc-2020-final-progress-report.pdf">more than 1,000 babies</a> die or are left with severe injuries each year as a result of something going wrong during labour and the <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/publications/themed-work/getting-safer-faster-key-areas-improvement-maternity-services">CQC has found</a> four in 10 maternity services are providing unacceptable levels of care. This goes beyond the general resourcing and staffing issues within the NHS that have created its biggest ever crisis; it reflects a cultural under-prioritisation of the care of women and their babies that has not been adequately addressed by successive administrations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/15/the-observer-view-on-how-the-uk-has-become-a-hostile-place-to-have-children">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russian missile attacks in Dnipro kill at least 12; UK pledges to send Ukraine tanks to ‘push Russian troops back’; power outages across Ukraine</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Russia carried out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/14/russia-carries-out-two-mass-rocket-strikes-on-ukraine-killing-at-least-five-people">two mass rocket attacks on Ukraine</a></strong> on Saturday, devastating an apartment block in Dnipro and leaving <strong>at least 12 people dead</strong> and many more injured, at least a dozen of them children. Rescue efforts were ongoing in the south-central city on Sunday. At least one person was also killed in a separate strike on a residential area in the nearby city of Kryvyi Rih. Ukrainian authorities said the targets were the country’s energy infrastructure.</p><p><strong>The UK prime minister has confirmed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/14/rishi-sunak-offers-tanks-ukraine-russian-troops-challenger-2-volodymyr-zelenskiy">the country will provide tanks to Ukraine</a> </strong>to help Kyiv’s forces “push Russian troops back”.<strong> </strong>Downing Street said Rishi Sunak made the pledge during a call on Saturday morning with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and that Sunak offered Challenger 2 tanks and additional artillery systems as a sign of the UK’s “ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine”. Russia’s embassy in Britain said the move would only “intensify” the conflict.</p><p><strong>Emergency power outages were enacted across 11 regions of Ukraine</strong> after Russian strikes on energy infrastructure. In a post on Telegram, grid operator Ukrenegro said the consumption limits in force across the country were exceeded in 11 regions, as a result of which “emergency shutdowns have been applied”.</p><p><strong>Four explosions were heard in central Kyiv on Saturday morning. </strong>For the first time since Russia began regular missile and drone attacks on the capital in autumn, the air raid sirens sounded after the attack. Until now, the sirens have sounded 10-90 minutes before an attack, giving residents time to seek shelter.</p><p><strong>Air raid alerts were also issued across the country</strong>, including in the major cities of Kherson and Lviv. Alerts were also issued for the regions of Kharkiv, Donestk, Dnipropetrovsk and about a dozen others.</p><p><strong>Ukraine has called on its allies to give it more support after its troops suffered heavy losses in fighting at Soledar and Bakhmut</strong> in recent months. Russia said on Friday its forces had taken control of Soledar in east Ukraine, its first claim of victory in months of battlefield setbacks, while Kyiv said fierce fighting was continuing in the town. “To win this war, we need more military equipment, heavy equipment,” said Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Agence France-Presse reported.</p><p><strong>Moldovan authorities said debris from a missile had been found in its territory </strong>near the border with Ukraine.

## Davos’s elite will need to do some soul-searching in a world falling apart

<p>The first proper World Economic Forum for three years will take place against a humbling backdrop of crisis and conflict</p><p>The war in Ukraine. A rapidly slowing economy, fragmentation and de-globalisation. The rising cost of living. Climate change. There is plenty for the global great and good to get their teeth into this week as Davos resumes after a three-year hiatus.</p><p>Strictly speaking, it not the first gathering of world leaders, businesspeople, academics and civil society since the start of the pandemic, but<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/can-davos-with-no-a-listers-still-play-a-part-on-the-global-stage"> last May’s World Economic Forum event</a> was a slimmed-down and not especially well-attended affair. As a dry run it was fine, but a real Davos traditionally happens in January, when the snow is thick on the ground in the Swiss village 1,500 metres up in the Alps. In the past, the mood at Davos has oscillated between extreme optimism and unbridled gloom, depending on the state of the world economy. This year it looks certain to be the latter. As Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chair of the WEF put it last week, “economic, environmental, social and geopolitical crises are converging and conflating”. The aim of this year’s Davos, he added, was to get rid of the “crisis mindset”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/15/davoss-elite-will-need-to-do-some-soul-searching-in-a-world-falling-apart">Continue reading...</a>
