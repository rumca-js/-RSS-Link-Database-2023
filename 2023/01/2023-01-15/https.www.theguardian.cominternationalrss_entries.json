Anyone fancy a pint?</p><p>Or this year, does another round feel less appealing? You\u2019re far from alone if, in 2023, you\u2019re considering calling time once and for all. Welcome to the era of the sober-<br />curious; the apparently ever-growing movement of people exploring what life could look like alcohol-free. Among young Brits, the numbers look irrefutable: between 2002 and 2019, the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds in England who reported monthly drinking fell from 67% to 41%. And while the stats don\u2019t show older adults <br />putting down the plonk on a permanent basis, something is shifting. According to Dry January\u2019s organisers, this year one in six UK adults who drink alcohol are attempting to participate. Alcohol-free beers were once a fringe choice; today they\u2019re found nationwide on supermarket shelves. No longer do 0% orders come with a side of pregnancy questions or bemused stares.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/15/last-orders-how-we-fell-out-of-love-with-alcohol\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/15/edelman-pr-firm-davos-trust", "title": "The world\u2019s biggest PR firm claims to be an expert on trust \u2013 but is it?", "date_published": "2023-01-15 08:00:07+00:00", "description": "<p>Edelman, which will publish the latest edition of its \u2018trust barometer\u2019 at Davos, says trust is its legacy \u2013 but critics say its reluctant to follow its own advice</p><p>At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week, the public relations juggernaut Edelman will publish the latest edition of its \u201ctrust barometer\u201d, an annual survey that purports to measure whether people around the world trust businesses, governments, NGOs and the media.</p><p>There\u2019s just one problem: even as Edelman promotes its brand and pursues clients with stern warnings about the importance of trust, critics charge the company appears reluctant to follow its own advice.
