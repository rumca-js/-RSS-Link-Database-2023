But the artist previously <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/arts/design/george-floyd-painting-catholic-university.html\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> it was created to mourn the death of George Floyd.  </p><p>So, while the statue of Martin Luther King is bad, at least it isn't blasphemous!
