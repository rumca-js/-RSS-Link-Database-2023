Speaking from home in Los Angeles, where he\u2019s currently at work on a mock true-crime audio show with Irvine Welsh, he calls his new book, <em>The Shards</em> \u2013 a high-school mystery first serialised on his podcast \u2013 \u201ca Bret Easton Ellis novel for people who don\u2019t like Bret Easton Ellis novels\u201d. Of whom, he adds, there are many: \u201cI am the worst-reviewed American writer of my generation. It\u2019s just a fact. If you can find another one, please, I\u2019d like to know; it\u2019s not Chuck Palahniuk, I can tell you that.\u201d<br /><br /><strong>Your previous book, </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/24/white-by-bret-easton-ellis-review-sound-fury-and-insignificance\">White</a></strong></em><strong>, which was mainly about movies and novels, was widely discussed as though it were only about Donald Trump, not least in a hostile </strong><em><strong>New Yorker</strong></em><strong> Q&amp;A. How did that feel?</strong><br />I think Trump really deranged mainstream media. Anyone who even came close to figuring out [his appeal] got deemed a traitor. The response perfectly illustrated what I was talking about and I can only be grateful: the book was kind of doing nothing and then the <em>New Yorker</em> thing appeared and suddenly we shot up to No 1 on about six different levels on Amazon. I got booked on Tucker Carlson, which sold a ton of books. Controversy helps! The negativity was <em>nothing</em> compared with <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/american-psycho-9781529077155\">American Psycho</a></em>. After <em>American Psycho</em>, people assumed I would never publish again. All 30 of my publishers around the world dropped me. Not one stood by me except for Picador.<br /><br /><strong>So why aren\u2019t you publishing </strong><em><strong>The Shards</strong></em><strong> with them?</strong><br />They didn\u2019t want it! I\u2019d been with them since I was 21 but something felt broken. They made a lowball offer and my agency made this decision to take a risk trying a new kind of deal [with Swift Press]. There is this antiquated notion in traditional publishing: \u201cGive the big fat advance! Never make it back! Promote a book that will never make anyone any money once that advance is given up!\u201d What if you partner with a publisher, don\u2019t take an advance and work together selling the product? Start making money for the house and yourself from book one. <br /><br /><strong>Did serialising the novel on your podcast shape its composition?</strong><br />I don\u2019t think it did. I knew the book\u2019s movements from the beginning, I just couldn\u2019t figure out how to tell it; I had to get old enough. I\u2019d been thinking about the book so often since first trying to write it in 1982 that when the spark ignited one night in April 2020, I had 14 pages the next day and just spent a year and a half finishing the rest.</p><p><strong>What drew you to the novel\u2019s autobiographical voice?</strong><br />It gave the project an immediacy I hadn\u2019t been able to locate for 40 years. I wasn\u2019t really thinking, oh, I\u2019m going to create a work of autofiction. I just wanted to write about some of my classmates and my somewhat sentimental feelings of nostalgia about a period in my life that was also extremely painful; to finally, at 58, look back at [being] that boy in 1981, a year that changed everything for me, and to write about it, and people I love, without embarrassment.</p><p><em>The Shards</em> is published by Swift Press (\u00a325) on 17 January.

The parlous state of the nation\u2019s health has prompted suggestions that we are now paying an \u201cimmunity debt\u201d incurred by the reduction of common infections during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> lockdowns of 2020 and 2021. But experts seem divided about whether the debt concept is genuine, let alone whether it explains the prevalence of non-Covid afflictions.</p><p>As with so many of the debates about the outcomes of the pandemic, there do not appear to be simple answers \u2013 but no shortage of self-proclaimed \u201cexperts\u201d ready to give them anyway. While there are good reasons to believe that the measures taken to reduce the spread of the coronavirus have broader implications for common infectious diseases, there is no one-case-fits-all explanation for the spate of winter bugs, much less any obvious conclusions to be drawn about pandemic management.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/14/immunity-debt-does-it-really-exist\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false, "language": "en-US", "user": null}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/14/turning-the-tide-with-a-nautical-themed-home-on-the-french-coast", "title": "Turning the tide with a nautical themed home on the French coast", "date_published": "2023-01-14 16:00:12+00:00", "description": "<p>A home on France\u2019s genteel Ile de R\u00e9 that pays homage to Tintin, elderly aunts and the seafaring past of this stunningly beautiful Atlantic island</p><p>Located off its west coast and linked to the mainland by a bridge, the Ile de R\u00e9 is one of France\u2019s most sought-after seaside destinations.

Butler-Bowdon threatened to throw it on the bonfire, saying \u201cthen we may be able to find ping pong balls and bats when we want them\u201d.

In her debut novel Victoria MacKenzie has distilled this chaotic, episodic rampage of a life into a beautifully lucid account of a spiritual adventure.
