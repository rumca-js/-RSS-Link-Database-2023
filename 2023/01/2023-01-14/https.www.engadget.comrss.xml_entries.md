<p>Twitter’s “For You” tab, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-for-ios-now-features-for-you-and-following-tabs-instead-of-the-sparkle-button-094006066.html">debuted on iOS devices earlier this week</a>, has begun rolling out to desktop web browsers. The new interface replaces the “sparkle” icon that previously allowed you to toggle between the platform’s algorithmically generated and reverse chronological feeds.</p><p>As<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/13/23550345/twitter-for-you-following-desktop-ios-android"><em>The Verge</em> notes</a>, the For You tab is now the default view you see when you first visit Twitter after the update is available on your web browser. That said, the desktop version doesn’t appear to force you to stick with the For You feed like Twitter’s updated iOS app does. When I visited the website on my computer, I switched to the “Following” view and then closed the browser tab where I was viewing my feed. When I opened a new tab and navigated back to Twitter, the site defaulted to the Following view.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b0025d64dc4a441184422eeae90e68fc"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">You can now easily switch between “For you” and “Following” on web.

However, at the end of last year, Musk tweeted that Twitter would move forward with the change. “Main timeline should allow for an easy sideways swipe between the top, latest, trending and topics that follow,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;Twitter search nav already sorta does this after you search.&quot;</p>

## Voice AI company SoundHound has reportedly laid off half its workforce

<p>SoundHound, the company that once said it wanted to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-31-soundhound-voice-ai-investment-compete-google-amazon.html"><ins>challenge Amazon and Google’s</ins></a> dominance in the AI voice market, has reportedly cut about half its workforce. According to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/soundhound-lays-off-half-employees-pitiful-severance-1849987534"><em><ins>Gizmodo</ins></em></a>, the firm laid off about 200 employees last week as part of a company-wide restructuring. If <em>Gizmodo’s</em> reporting is accurate, the mass layoffs would mark the second staff reduction SoundHound has undertaken in less than a year. In November, the company reportedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/10/soundhound-layoffs/"><ins>laid off 10 percent of its workforce</ins></a>. Before the first round of cuts, SoundHound employed approximately 450 people.</p><p>A trio of former employees who spoke to <em>Gizmodo </em>described a “pitiful” severance package contingent on the company raising more money. They claim the package includes no healthcare and only two weeks of severance. The company did not immediately respond to Engadget’s request for comment. SoundCloud went public via a special-purpose acquisition company in early 2022. According to data from <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/soundhound/company_financials"><ins>CrunchBase</ins></a>, the firm has raised more than $300 million to date. SoundHound customers include Pandora, Mercedes-Benz and Snap.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In an email obtained by <em>Gizmodo</em>, SoundHound CEO and co-founder Keyvan Mohajer blamed the layoffs on recent macroeconomic conditions. “When we set course in early 2021 to become publicly listed, high-tech companies like SoundHound were the darlings of the investor community. Companies who could achieve high growth, despite high costs, were seen as engines of a future economy, ” he wrote. “However, as a result of changing economic conditions, including high interest rates, rising inflation, and fears of recession, companies with our profile became much less desirable.” Mohajer reportedly went on to add investors “were concerned” SoundHound did “not have the heart to let go of its people.”</p><p>In the last few months, mass layoffs have been a frequent occurrence at many tech companies. At the start of November, Facebook parent Meta cut about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html"><ins>13 percent of its workforce</ins></a>, a move that saw more than 11,000 people lose their jobs. More recently, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html">expanded the scope</a> of its company-wide layoffs to affect more than 18,000 employees.</p>

## Court rejects Elon Musk’s request to move Tesla shareholder trial out of San Francisco

<p>A federal judge has denied Elon Musk’s request to move his upcoming trial against a group of Tesla shareholders to Texas, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/13/23553916/elon-musk-trial-request-move-california-texas-judge-reject"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/13/23553916/elon-musk-trial-request-move-california-texas-judge-reject"><em>The Verge</em></a>). <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-asks-court-to-move-tesla-shareholder-trial-to-texas-202449079.html">On January 7th</a>, less than two weeks before the trial was scheduled to begin on the 17th, Musk’s legal team asked to move proceedings out of California, claiming “a substantial portion” of the potential jury pool in San Francisco was likely to hold a bias against the billionaire, in part due to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-has-reportedly-laid-off-more-of-its-infrastructure-team-192330953.html">ongoing layoffs at Twitter</a>.</p><p>The upcoming civil trial stems from a class action lawsuit related to “false and misleading” statements Musk made in 2018 when he said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share. Musk’s “<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776?s=20&amp;t=bI5TaM4bx9Dnc3ZFSwjp9w">funding secured</a>” tweet drew the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, eventually leading to a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776?s=20&amp;t=bI5TaM4bx9Dnc3ZFSwjp9w">$40 million settlement</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The shareholders involved in the suit allege Musk’s tweet affected Tesla’s stock price. They’re asking the court to order Musk to stop his “public campaign to present a contradictory and false narrative” of the episode. They say he should also be accountable for potential damages. The group <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-funding-secured-tweet-misleading-shareholder-lawsuit-205058441.html">won an early victory</a> last spring when District Judge Edward Chen concluded Musk had “recklessly made the statements with knowledge as to their falsity.”</p><p>Of the approximately 200 candidates the court is considering for the jury, 82 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion of Musk in a pre-trial questionnaire. Ahead of the recent hearing, Alex Spiro, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-cuts-alex-spiro-232831688.html">Musk’s lawyer</a>, said the sheet showed “not only that a vast majority of potential jurors hold ill-will toward Mr. Musk. but that they are not afraid to declare it proudly and vividly to the court.” However, Judge Chen didn’t buy Spiro’s argument. Alluding to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elizabeth-holmes-sentencing-11-years-200015544.html">recently concluded Theranos trial</a>, Chen said a fellow judge in a nearby courthouse was able to assemble an “unbiased” jury to decide whether Elizabeth Holmes was guilty of criminal charges. He also dismissed the idea of moving the case to Texas, noting Tesla’s main office was located in California when Tesla shareholders sued Musk.</p>

## FAA's NOTAM computer outage affected military flights

<p>On January 11th, the Federal Aviation Administration <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-grounds-us-flights-notam-computer-outage-124946230.html">paused all domestic departures</a> in the US after its Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system failed. The agency later <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/12/tech/faa-notam-system-outage">revealed</a> that the outage was caused by a database file that was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-notam-outage-explanation-193048158.html">damaged</a> by &quot;personnel who failed to follow procedures.&quot; Now, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/01/13/faa-meltdown-delays-military/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, the database failure also created issues for tools used by US military pilots.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the affected systems was the Defense Internet NOTAM Service (DINS), which typically comes with FAA alerts regarding flight hazards. During the outage, military pilots were either getting NOTAMs in duplicates or not getting any at all. <em>The Post</em> said an FAA bulletin notified military users that the system had become &quot;impaired and unreliable.&quot; Unlike civilian flights, which had to be grounded, military flights can proceed in situations like this. An Air Force spokesperson told the outlet that the military branch's pilots had to call around to ask for potential flight hazards themselves.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The outage had also erased all NOTAMs submitted to the system starting on Tuesday afternoon, so airports and air traffic controllers were asked to re-submit them. Further, the FAA had to deal with delays and other challenges after the system went back up due to a &quot;high system load.&quot;</p><p>The FAA is still verifying what caused the outage, but<em> The Post</em> said it's looking like the contractors truly made mistake and that there was no malicious intent behind their actions. Lawmakers are using this opportunity to put a spotlight on the FAA's outdated technology and to seek funding for upgrades. The computer system that failed and led to the outage is already three decades old, and according to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/12/tech/faa-notam-system-outage"><em>CNN</em></a>, it's also at least six years away from getting an upgrade. It remains to be seen if the incident will change that timeline.</p>

<p>If you need a little help keeping your home clean in the new year, a robot vacuum can help. It may not be an essential piece of tech, especially if you already have a decent vacuum, but it can make consistent cleaning much easier by letting you automate a portion of the process.

Combine that with cleaning schedules that you can set in the mobile app and you may be able to leave your Roomba unattended as it sucks up dirt in your house, day in and day out, for weeks on end. The j7+ has obstacle avoidance technology that helps it detect things like pet poop and navigate around them as it cleans. The s9+, on the other hand, has the strongest suction power of any iRobot machine and it has a more corner-friendly design, too.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>

## Twitter opens early access signups for organization verification

<p>Twitter is now accepting signups for those who to be among the first to access the verification for organizations program. It was previously known as Blue for Business, the company said in its announcement, along with a link to the <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/form/verification-for-organizations.html">sign-up form</a>. Organizations will have to submit their names, Twitter usernames and websites to be considered for the waitlist. They also have to indicate their size and the expected number of affiliated accounts. If you'll recall, Musk previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-organization-related-accounts-verification-194525167.html">announced</a> that the website will roll out a feature that will give organizations the capability to identify accounts that are actually associated with them.</p><p>His announcement came after a rather <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html">disastrous</a> launch of Twitter's paid verification system, which gave rise to a bunch of verified trolls impersonating companies, celebrities and other high-profile personalities.

That will make posing as a company or a government agency difficult for random users. The company ultimately had to pause Blue's initial rollout due to the influx of impersonators before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-monday-11-per-month-ios-221436172.html">relaunching it in December</a> with an $11-per-month price tag.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter will <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1613995936585519104">publish</a> its &quot;tweet recommendation code&quot; and will make tweet and account status visible &quot;no later than next month,&quot; Musk has revealed, as well. Presumably, that means users will know if they've been shadowbanned and their tweets aren't showing up for other people. &quot;Transparency builds trust,&quot; he added. In addition, he announced that the website is moving the bookmark button to the tweet details page and is fixing its image auto-cropping feature next week.</p>
