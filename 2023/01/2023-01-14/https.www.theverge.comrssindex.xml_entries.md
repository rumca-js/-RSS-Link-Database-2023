  <p id="qEXQvU">Can Tesla remain the leader in the modern electric vehicle market it effectively created? </p>
<p id="5qPSmR">That question has been on the mind of EV buyers, investors, analysts, industry watchers, and Elon Musk stans for months now. That’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/29/23529744/tesla-elon-musk-year-review-stock-price-cybertruck-delays">especially been the case as questions over demand</a> in China and the US — not to mention <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation">the Twitter drama</a> — seemed to cast a shadow on the electric automaker’s success story. </p>
<p id="NBqIIX">On Thursday night, Tesla revealed its answer to this problem, at least for now: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/13/23553295/tesla-price-cuts-us-europe-2023">steep price cuts on its lineup of cars</a>, which in some cases amount to as much as 30 percent off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/1/23534707/ev-tax-credit-eligible-vehicle-list-tesla-chevy-cadillac-vw">when the latest EV tax credits are applied as well</a>. </p>

  <p id="zeFQxk">It’s Friday night in the US, and the music is not playing on Spotify for many people. Users report streams suddenly stopped, and for people who’ve logged out, some say they can’t log in again. </p>
<p id="miERrq">The outage has garnered over 30,000 reports on <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/spotify/">DownDetector.com</a>, starting just before 8PM ET and rising sharply since then.  A <a href="https://status.spotify.dev/">status page for the company’s web API</a> indicates a “minor” partial outage affecting only the player itself, which is consistent with what we’re seeing — but that’s also the most important part of Spotify. </p>

  <p id="EOAQ3o">The “E” in the name of Toyota’s legendary AE86 was there to designate it as a Corolla, but wouldn’t it be awesome if it stood for “electric” instead? Apparently someone at the company thought so; <a href="https://youtu.be/eP2YsAqMsMU?t=2067">Toyota is showing off</a> a concept version of what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBRy4-__oh0">the 80s icon</a> would look like if it were powered by batteries (or hydrogen). The two cars are being exhibited at the Tokyo Auto Salon show, which runs from January 13th to the 15th.</p>
<p id="RqCWgQ">The AE86 BEV Concept uses “electrification technologies cultivated by Lexus,” according to <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/38537253.html">Toyota’s website</a>, with parts from a hybrid Tundra and Prius.

  <p id="ZidbSw">When electric vehicle owners take longer trips, they often rely on nationwide fast charging providers like EVgo, Electrify America, and ChargePoint to reach their destinations. So it can be more than a minor inconvenience for EV drivers if they arrive at a station with problems like damaged cables, disconnected modems, or annoying error codes.</p>
<p id="N4uxMD">This year, EVgo is looking to leave behind broken and unreliable EV chargers with its <a href="https://www.evgo.com/press-release/evgo-launches-evgo-renew-to-enhance-and-improve-fast-charging-experience-nationwide/">ReNew program</a> that bolsters site maintenance efforts across its more than 850 fast charging stations with 1,700 or so charging stalls. It’ll also upgrade older stations with new hardware that enables up to 350kW charging for capable vehicles like the GMC Hummer EV.</p>
