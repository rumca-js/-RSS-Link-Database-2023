<p>The cherubic figure is gone as he helps transform his new club from serial strugglers into well-organised, battling contenders</p><p>Remember the Eddie Howe of a decade ago? Remember how pleasant he seemed, with his ruddy cheeks and blond hair, how he looked less like a football manager than a minor character from <em>Downton Abbey</em>? Remember the compelling interviews, the articulacy and understated charisma that seemed to emphasise his fundamental niceness?</p><p>And the poor love hated leaving Bournemouth. As a player, two games at Portsmouth were quite enough and he was soon back to his spiritual home. As a manager, well, Burnley, with its wild moors and dark energy, never seemed a natural fit. Best to stay amid the familiar beaches and boarding houses of Bournemouth, where Pep Guardiola could praise the quality of his football (which is to say the ease with which Manchester City could beat them) and nobody was too bothered by them conceding an average 66 goals per season – it was after all, a miracle they were in the Premier League at all. Bless him, good old Eddie, with his pretty, unthreatening football and his inability to organise a defence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/14/eddie-howes-gritty-newcastle-wont-win-hearts-but-silverware-is-in-reach">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For Celtic, a return to Hampden Park for the League Cup final in late February. This ­tournament is often derided as the poor ­relation of Scotland’s three main ­domestic ­competitions but it holds a special place in the heart of Ange Postecoglou. This marked the first trophy the Australian claimed as the Celtic ­manager. Without it, there is no chance of a much-coveted treble.</p><p>As Celtic celebrated, Kilmarnock were due high praise. They posed as much of a challenge to Postecoglou’s expensively ­assembled team as has been delivered by ­anyone in Scotland this season. Kilmarnock were ­tactically superb and provided attacking menace. There may be no consolation in being ­losing ­semi-finalists but onlookers could not fail to be impressed by the ­showing of the huge ­underdogs. Celtic had to scrap and scrape their way towards the final, where Aberdeen or Rangers lie in wait.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/14/celtic-kilmarnock-scottish-league-cup-semi-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When fashion demands that females mutilate themselves, it begins to look a lot like abuse</p><p>It’s a rather mixed message. No sooner have we given birth to a new female beauty trend than we line up to make fun of those stupid enough to follow it. You may have heard of the new craze for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/30/buccal-fat-why-cosmetic-surgeons-are-removing-this-unassuming-body-part">buccal fat removal</a>, where a surgeon cuts out a glob of your cheek to give you sharper cheekbones. Chrissy Teigen is the only celebrity known to have “admitted” to the procedure, but already there is widespread mockery of famous women hollow-cheeked enough to raise our suspicions. Yes, you heard me. Buccal fat removal is in. But also very much out.</p><p>This push and pull is familiar. Large breasts were once in fashion, but there was a simultaneous trend for disdaining women who went and got some, as well as for the naturally (snigger) “endowed”. (Who could take them seriously? Certainly not Michael Parkinson, who, in a famous interview with Helen Mirren, asked her if her “equipment” made her an “unserious actress”.) In Hollywood, facelifts are still practically demanded of older actresses, but beware the “insecure victims” who get them done. “She’s looking remarkably fresh-faced,” tabloids tut meaningfully, or perhaps put the message more directly: “What on earth has she done to her face?” They tend not to dwell on the howling absence in the Hollywood lineup: older women who have not done things to their faces.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/14/buccal-fat-removal-is-a-new-take-on-an-old-theme-a-means-to-keep-women-in-their-place">Continue reading...</a>

## Bret Easton Ellis: ‘James and the Giant Peach changed my life’

<p>The provocative novelist on looking back at his teenage self, the sales generated by a hostile Q&amp;A and his obsession with Marilyn Monroe</p><p>Bret Easton Ellis, 58, is the author of nine books, most recently <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/white-9781529012392">White</a></em> (2019), a memoir of culture and politics that describes, among other things, the impact of reading Thomas Tryon’s violent 1971 horror classic <em>The Other</em> when he was seven years old. Speaking from home in Los Angeles, where he’s currently at work on a mock true-crime audio show with Irvine Welsh, he calls his new book, <em>The Shards</em> – a high-school mystery first serialised on his podcast – “a Bret Easton Ellis novel for people who don’t like Bret Easton Ellis novels”. Of whom, he adds, there are many: “I am the worst-reviewed American writer of my generation. It’s just a fact. If you can find another one, please, I’d like to know; it’s not Chuck Palahniuk, I can tell you that.”<br /><br /><strong>Your previous book, </strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/24/white-by-bret-easton-ellis-review-sound-fury-and-insignificance">White</a></strong></em><strong>, which was mainly about movies and novels, was widely discussed as though it were only about Donald Trump, not least in a hostile </strong><em><strong>New Yorker</strong></em><strong> Q&amp;A. How did that feel?</strong><br />I think Trump really deranged mainstream media. Anyone who even came close to figuring out [his appeal] got deemed a traitor. The response perfectly illustrated what I was talking about and I can only be grateful: the book was kind of doing nothing and then the <em>New Yorker</em> thing appeared and suddenly we shot up to No 1 on about six different levels on Amazon. I got booked on Tucker Carlson, which sold a ton of books. Controversy helps! The negativity was <em>nothing</em> compared with <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/american-psycho-9781529077155">American Psycho</a></em>. After <em>American Psycho</em>, people assumed I would never publish again. All 30 of my publishers around the world dropped me. Not one stood by me except for Picador.<br /><br /><strong>So why aren’t you publishing </strong><em><strong>The Shards</strong></em><strong> with them?</strong><br />They didn’t want it! I’d been with them since I was 21 but something felt broken. They made a lowball offer and my agency made this decision to take a risk trying a new kind of deal [with Swift Press]. There is this antiquated notion in traditional publishing: “Give the big fat advance! Never make it back! Promote a book that will never make anyone any money once that advance is given up!” What if you partner with a publisher, don’t take an advance and work together selling the product? Start making money for the house and yourself from book one. <br /><br /><strong>Did serialising the novel on your podcast shape its composition?</strong><br />I don’t think it did. I knew the book’s movements from the beginning, I just couldn’t figure out how to tell it; I had to get old enough. I’d been thinking about the book so often since first trying to write it in 1982 that when the spark ignited one night in April 2020, I had 14 pages the next day and just spent a year and a half finishing the rest.</p><p><strong>What drew you to the novel’s autobiographical voice?</strong><br />It gave the project an immediacy I hadn’t been able to locate for 40 years. I wasn’t really thinking, oh, I’m going to create a work of autofiction. I just wanted to write about some of my classmates and my somewhat sentimental feelings of nostalgia about a period in my life that was also extremely painful; to finally, at 58, look back at [being] that boy in 1981, a year that changed everything for me, and to write about it, and people I love, without embarrassment.</p><p><em>The Shards</em> is published by Swift Press (£25) on 17 January.

Even if he’d wanted to, he probably picked the wrong moment, the public still being in an exceptionally forgiving mood.</p><p>For all his divulging, to seriously “stain” or “trash”, as alleged, the royal brand, Harry needed to produce something meatier than, say, Charles’s well-documented self-pity, his teen bride, protracted infidelity, black spider memos, choice of valet, honour-seeking donors, magical thinking, property empire, political interference and dreadful taste in mentors, all of which faults were instantly forgiven the day he succeeded. It’s one of the historic bonuses of a hereditary monarchy that sound personal references are not a condition of employment. Even GB News is more demanding than this. With just a little care for appearances, a royal idler, boor, sex addict or fool can enjoy the exact same benefits as a more deserving predecessor.</p><p>Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Wolves jumped out of the Premier League relegation zone at West Ham’s expense after Daniel Podence struck the only goal in a game light on quality. West Ham have won one of their past 10 league matches, at Bournemouth in October, and their next match at home to Everton next weekend has taken on extra significance. </p><p>Wolves went for the jugular as the game ticked towards the final whistle and Ruben Neves clattered the upright with a wonderful strike with 15 minutes of normal time to play.

<p>After flying so high last season, Liverpool are experiencing some crashing lows. Defeat to an inspired, superb Brighton may be the lowest yet. This was a mournful performance from Jürgen Klopp’s team, one of submission to a team who have moved into a different gear under Roberto de Zerbi. That their first two goals came from Solly March, who joined the club when a League One outfit, served to remind of how far they have come.</p><p>Moisés Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister, together in midfield for the first time since 13 November, were dominant. Mac Allister, wearing his World Cup medal, had received a pre-match standing ovation. Both South Americans have been lately linked with moves to Liverpool, where Klopp had opted for the midfield old guard of Jordan Henderson, Thiago and Fabinho.

<p>United’s controversial equaliser exposed a major flaw in the rules but also gave them a platform to close the gap on City</p><p>A forward makes a run for a through-ball. The defender steps up. The ball is played and the forward is in an offside position. The forward chases the ball, following it, escorting it. Something in his head – perhaps Bruno Fernandes screaming – warns him that he might be offside and so he pulls away, allowing another forward (let’s call him “Bruno Fernandes”) to sweep the ball into the net. Is that forward offside?</p><p>He hasn’t touched the ball but can he be deemed to not have been interfering? Did his presence not prevent the initial defender charging back and trying to hook the ball away? It’s the sort of question that could have kept medieval theologians occupied for a lifetime. Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas would have written controversial tracts upon it, then those tracts would have been analysed and those analyses themselves analysed. Whole libraries would have been devoted to the theme. To what extent, if God is omniscient, can we have free will? If our thinking is flawed, can any revelation escape flaw?

<p>(Basin Rock)<br />Accompanied by her husband, brother and uncle, the singer’s sparse, jazz-tinged record, which circles around a family tragedy, feels timeless</p><p>Right on cue for the dark days of winter comes this pensive, intimate album, conceived and recorded in the south Norwegian countryside. The house where its eight songs were captured stands on the cover, with twentysomething<a href="https://junihabel.bandcamp.com/album/carvings"> Juni Habel</a> on its step and its owner, her grandmother, looking on from a window. Habel’s brother, husband and uncle are among those adding small accompaniments to her spare, acoustic guitar – bass, strings, glockenspiel – though it’s her vocals, mixed to the fore and sometimes double-tracked, that dominate the record’s intense, twilit atmosphere.</p><p>The songs are sad but considered, their melancholia held at bay by Habel’s strength of character and touching lyrics. It’s a family affair in more ways than one, with several songs addressed to Habel’s teenage sister, whom she lost in a car accident. Titles such as I Went Out and Sought for Your Name and I Carry You, My Love tell their own story, but there is resilience and a faith in nature woven into their sorrow. That the album’s jazz-tinged brand of folk could as easily have come from the 1970s as the present day is no criticism.

Not only for the stated reason – that the practice of writing a 4,000-character essay about yourself is seen to favour middle-class kids (and the genetically smug) – but also because the temptations of help from artificial intelligence are increasingly hard to resist.

I volunteered at local schools and tutored my peers.” Or, prompted differently: “Growing up in a middle-class background, I have had opportunities to help me excel academically and personally.

<p>The latest claims by scientists that they are able to break the most common digital encryption system are far-fetched   </p><p>Security in a digital world requires that our communications are safe from digital eavesdroppers. The way we do that is to encrypt our messages using mathematical tools. The most powerful of these use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor_function">trapdoor functions</a> – that is, ones that work easily in one direction (making encryption easy) but not in the other (making decryption difficult).</p><p>Trapdoor functions utilise a property of multiplication – its asymmetry. It’s simple to multiply two numbers together, for example, 971 and 1,249, to get 1,212,779, but it’s quite hard to start with 1,212,779 and work out which two prime numbers (its factors) have to be multiplied to produce it. And the task becomes exponentially harder the bigger the original numbers are. Which is why, up to now, computer scientists believe that it’s impossible <em>in practice</em> for a conventional computer, no matter how powerful, to factorise any number that’s longer than 2,048 bits.

Because it would take it 300tn years, or about <a href="https://www.itpro.com/security/encryption/368915/how-quantum-computing-could-change-cyber-security/">22,000 times longer than the age of the universe</a> (to use just one of the popular analogies), for the machine to crack the problem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/14/computers-need-to-make-a-quantum-leap-before-they-can-crack-encrypted-messages">Continue reading...</a>

Renowned for its picture-perfect villages and 60 miles of sandy coastline, it has, over the years, attracted a well-heeled, essentially bourgeois crowd, as well as celebrities such as Vanessa Paradis, the late designer Christian Liaigre, Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry. Another fan is Virginie Deniot, who has managed her brother Jean-Louis’s Paris-based interior design firm for the past two decades.</p><p>Virginie still clearly recalls her first visit to the island in 2008. “I fell in love with it,” she says. “The light is incredible and it has such charm. There are vineyards, tractors and fields, and at the same time ports, sailing boats and beaches.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/14/turning-the-tide-with-a-nautical-themed-home-on-the-french-coast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Todd Field’s masterly film echoes the slippery genius of its protagonist, a brilliant conductor-composer who toys with her admirers</p><p>The genius of Todd Field’s superb <em>Tár</em> comes from the way the film-making echoes the treacherously seductive and mercurial nature of its central character. Lydia Tár (an electrifying Cate Blanchett) is a dazzling talent: a world-class conductor and composer with a towering ego to match her formidable professional reputation. She describes herself, in a rare, entirely insincere moment of self-deprecation, as “a U-haul lesbian”, but in fact she is one half of a Berlin Philharmonic power couple: her partner is the lead violinist, Sharon Goodnow (Nina Hoss).</p><p>Tár is magnificent. At the same time she’s a monster, a capricious narcissist who charms a series of young women, all rising stars in classical music, who subsequently find their careers stymied when they fly too close to the blistering heat of her self-regard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/14/tar-review-todd-field-cate-blanchett-dazzles-as-monstrous-maestro">Continue reading...</a>

Let’s hope she does. She is perfectly suited, and has ideal musical companions in Spence, and in Brown, who helps you hear the orchestral colours in his playing. <em>Das Lied</em>, an impassioned if lopsided work, becomes more approachable on this scale – a good way in to a work that can seem overwhelming.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/14/mahler-das-lied-von-der-erde-piano-version-claudia-huckle-nicky-spence-justin-brown-review-gothic-voices-the-splendour-of-florence-with-a-burgundian-resonance-joanna-and-the-maestro-podcast-lumley-barlow">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The congressman’s many lies are the product of a political system that incentivizes dishonesty and punishes sincerity</p><p>It’s hard to keep track of what, exactly, the newly elected Republican congressman George Santos has said about his own life. His story changes and contradicts itself; his lies seem indiscriminate, and largely ad hoc. He says he worked at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, which he didn’t. He said he graduated from Baruch College – he didn’t do that, either. Some of his fabrications are so trivial and specific that it’s impossible to ascribe a nefarious motive to them.</p><p>What could Santos possibly have to gain, for instance, by claiming, as he apparently did to a local Republican party leader, to have been a <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/01/george-santos-lies-he-also-was-not-a-volleyball-star.html">college volleyball champion</a>? Others are transparently self-serving, his attempts to cover them up so brazen as to be frankly hilarious. On the campaign trail, running in the heavily Jewish third district of New York, on suburban Long Island, Santos claimed that he was “a member of the Jewish community”, and descended from Ukrainian refugees. When this turned out to be untrue, he later tried to claim that he merely meant that he was “Jew-<em>ish</em>”. It was like a line from Seinfeld; punning, implausible, shameless. At times like this, it’s hard to take Santos’s dishonesty seriously. It seems less like an affront to the dignity of the democratic process and more like some kind of durational satire, a piece of performance art.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/14/george-santos-politician-americans-deserve">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As identical twins, Lydia and I shared everything, but when she had her second miscarriage a few days before I gave birth, it would test our bond to the limit </p><p>I was days away from giving birth and was discussing pain relief with my NCT friends when the WhatsApp message came through from my twin sister. “No baby.” To the point. No frills. Just like her. The message, a punch to the stomach, was followed by a sad-face emoji that seemed both insufficient at conveying the agony felt by its sender and utterly devastating in its everyday-ness. My extremities went tingly, then numb, and suddenly I felt oddly hollow and weightless, as though someone had scooped out my insides and replaced them with helium. And then, another punch to the stomach, a real one this time: my unborn son reminding me that I wasn’t, in fact, hollow or, indeed, full of helium. I was full of baby. And my sister, my other half, my womb mate, was not.</p><p>It is a myth, I’m sorry to say, that twins are psychic, although it’s one my identical twin sister, Lydia, and I often played up to at parties by agreeing answers to set questions. (She was always thinking of a triangle; I was always thinking of the colour blue.) But when she messaged me just after lunch one Friday at the beginning of February 2021, asking if I was free to chat, I knew she was going to tell me she was pregnant. Perhaps it was twin instinct or perhaps it was simply because my partner and I had, that weekend, been discussing our own plans to start a family, but I was right: she was.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/14/twins-coping-with-pregnancy-and-miscarriage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She was a successful defence barrister from a grand French family. Then she came out, and found herself in a fierce custody battle. As she publishes her first book in English, the author talks about motherhood, love and attitudes to gay life</p><p>“There’s always a price to pay for freedom,” says Constance Debré, running a hand over her shaved head and her neck tattoo that reads “plutôt crêver” (“rather die”). The 50-year-old author, who faced a fierce custody battle over her young son after coming out as gay in her mid 40s, adds: “To me, that’s a happier, livelier way to see things: rather than saying there are injustices or blows raining down on you, you realise it’s all because you’re living life in the way you want, seeking out an existence … trying to give life some shape. That’s why life and literature are so connected: it’s the quest for form.”</p><p>Debré tore up the rule book of French writing with a bestselling trilogy based on the dramatic turn her life took after she came out. The darkly comic, first-person account of a separated mother’s Don Juan-style conquests of women is interwoven with scenes of her “taking an automatic rifle” to her bourgeois life as a criminal defence barrister from a famous French political dynasty. More than a coming-out saga, Debré likens it to a Saint Augustine-style conversion, a total transformation. The protagonist and narrator, who is not named, is clearly Debré herself, following in a long French tradition of creative writers who draw closely on real-life events – the most notable being last year’s Nobel laureate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/06/annie-ernaux-the-2022-nobel-literature-laureates-greatest-works">Annie Ernaux</a>. Yet though the events are real, Debré firmly considers her work fiction rather than autobiography or memoir, because it relies on the literary art of constructing a narrative, creating a relationship between a character and events. “What makes a novel is its form,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/14/family-is-the-place-for-madness-constance-debre-on-the-book-that-has-shocked-france">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This electrifying debut compares the spiritual adventures of Margery Kempe and Julian of Norwich</p><p>This is an extraordinary novel about two extraordinary women, the books they wrote and how those books survived. In 1934, while looking for a ping pong ball in the house of Lieutenant Colonel William Butler-Bowdon, a guest stumbled upon the only complete manuscript of The Book of Margery Kempe. Butler-Bowdon threatened to throw it on the bonfire, saying “then we may be able to find ping pong balls and bats when we want them”. Fortunately he changed his mind, and the manuscript of the earliest English autobiography is now safely in the British Library.</p><p>Born in 1373, one-time brewer Margery Kempe had visions of Christ which set her off on a series of rambunctious, incident-packed pilgrimages to the Holy Land, Santiago de Compostela and Prussia. She dressed in white, like a virgin, despite having at least 14 children. She was tried for heresy several times but always managed to successfully rebut the charges. In her debut novel Victoria MacKenzie has distilled this chaotic, episodic rampage of a life into a beautifully lucid account of a spiritual adventure. The Margery who emerges is boastful, vulnerable, courageous, confused, mouthy, libidinous, attentive and impossible not to love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/14/for-thy-great-pain-have-mercy-on-my-little-pain-by-victoria-mackenzie-review-a-pocket-epic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>UN atomic watchdog will soon have a permanent presence at all five of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. Follow live</p><p>The UN nuclear watchdog announced on Friday it was boosting its presence in Ukraine to help prevent a nuclear accident during the current conflict, AFP reports.</p><p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it would soon have a permanent presence at all five of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, including Chernobyl – the plant closed after the 1986 disaster.</p><p><strong>Ukraine has denied Russia’s claim that Vladimir Putin’s forces have captured Soledar. </strong>On Friday, as Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had taken full control of the salt-mining town, Ukrainian officials denied the Russian claim, suggesting they were still holding on and counterattacking, with the Ukrainian military spokesperson Serhii Cherevatyi reporting “ongoing battles”.</p><p><strong>Soledar is “Verdun for 21st century” according to a top Ukraine official. </strong>Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the president of Ukraine, likened the fight for the town to the longest and bloodiest battle in the first world war.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces defending Bakhmut and Soledar in the east would be armed with everything they need</strong> to keep Russian troops at bay in some of the bloodiest fighting of the war.</p><p><strong>Hundreds of civilians remain trapped in Soledar, Ukraine has said</strong>. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk, told Ukrainian state TV that 559 civilians remained in Soledar, including 15 children, and could not be evacuated.</p><p><strong>Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies show the destruction inflicted upon Soledar.</strong> The Guardian has a series of striking images from inside the eastern Ukrainian town.</p><p><strong>Ukraine is confident Britain will announce it plans to send about 10 Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv shortly</strong>, a move it hopes will help Germany finally allow its Leopard 2s to be re-exported to the embattled country. A formal announcement is anticipated on Monday but Ukrainian sources indicated they understood that Britain had already decided in favour.</p><p><strong>Putin’s move to replace his top commander in Ukraine after a few months is a sign of military disarray and his growing impatience in a war Russia is not winning</strong>, analysts said. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Wednesday it had, again, replaced its top commander in Ukraine, putting the army chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, in charge. It is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/russia-replaces-general-in-charge-of-ukraine-war-in-latest-military-shake-up">latest of several major shake-ups</a> of Moscow’s military leadership.</p><p><strong>Germany will continue to “weigh every step carefully” and consult with its allies on further weapons deliveries to Ukraine, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said. </strong>The German leader is facing mounting pressure to approve German-made battle tanks for Kyiv. Scholz said Berlin would keep its “leading position” as one of Kyiv’s top supporters but said he had no intention of being rushed on “such serious things that have to do with peace and war, with the security of our country and of Europe”.</p><p><strong>A US navy veteran has been released after almost a year in Russian detention, according to his family. Taylor Dudley,</strong> 35, of Michigan, was taken into custody by Russian border police last April after crossing the border from Poland into Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-iaea-boosting-presence-to-avert-serious-nuclear-accident">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Last year the bright, kind law graduate was brutally murdered as she walked home after a night out. Now her friends and family are striving to create meaning from the tragedy</p><p>Five weeks before she was murdered, 35-year-old Zara Aleena started work at the Royal Courts of Justice. On her first day, she sent a brightly smiling selfie to her friends and family, saying she couldn’t believe she was actually there. It was an administrative role that took her one step closer to her lifelong dream of being a lawyer; something she had pursued doggedly even as her studies were interrupted by caring responsibilities and financial concerns. After passing the solicitors’ exams with distinction and landing this new job, Aleena felt a new stage of her life was beginning. Her aunt Farah Naz told her: “Soon, Zara, you are going to be a formidable force.”</p><p>On the evening of 26 June 2022, Aleena met a friend at a local pub, the Great Spoon of Ilford. They had dinner and a drink there before moving on to a bar, where Aleena drank water. Around 2am, they left. The friend got in a cab, but Aleena walked; she was close to home and it was a warm evening. When her other aunt, Smaira Naz, imagines her walking that night, she thinks of how Aleena always had a spring in her step. “She had this bounce when she walked – it was lovely, so much energy,” she says. “Walking made her feel free.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/14/a-thief-came-into-our-family-and-took-the-heart-out-of-it-the-killing-of-zara-aleena">Continue reading...</a>
